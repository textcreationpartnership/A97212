            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Author to the Chriſtian Reader, eſpecially ſuch who are his Comrades and Brethren, in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of this Commonwealth.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Shall tell thee no long ſtory of experience to draw on thy belief to embrace either truth, or error, nor do I think that an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument ſufficient to perſwade men; beſides their reaſon, and Conſcience. Tis that which Gods word condemns, in that boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Church, who to intice and allure others, cryed out ſhe was rich, and indued with ſubſtance, and want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing; when yet ſhe was poor and miſerable, and blind and naked. He that hath faith in this ſenſe, let him have it to himſelf before God, and happy is he that condemns not himſelf in the things he allows. Theſe are boaſting days, wherein men in falſe ways under falſe Ordinances, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to have much communion with God: A day is coming when their works will be manifeſt, whether wrought in God or not, when wood, hey, and ſtubble will be burnt up: the work is already on the wheele, and a poor doubting Chriſtian then wil lye neerer Chriſts heart, then fleſhly boaſters: it is not mens pretences to be acquainted with the depths of God, that will
<pb facs="tcp:168338:3"/> make them ſound Chriſtians, ſuch there were in the firſt times of the Goſpel, that would be talking of depths: but the holy Ghoſt, calls them Satans depths. I could heartily wiſh that the Author of the new Doctrine of baptiſm had no cauſe to doubt of the currantneſs of his coin, I mean of his principles for heaven: but this I am bold to ſay, that did I pretend to be ſuch a maſter in the ſchool of experience, I ſhould not onely queſtion all my teaching, but learning alſo; eſpecially when it comes with ſuch high ſwelling words againſt the ways of God: and let me tell thee, though I have no cauſe to boaſt of any thing; yet in this I will lay my experience againſt his: rejoyce, and boaſt, with much confidence, and aſſurance, that thoſe Ordinances which he calls counterfeits, and cryes down for error, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſtamps ſuch a black brand of reproach up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, throughout his whole book, ſhall ſtand and triumph as the glorious truths of Jeſus Chriſt, in matter of worſhip, when all his miſts and fogs ſhall be diſpelled with the ſon of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. The Reaſons of my undertaking this task, are theſe which follow;</p>
            <p n="1">1 Firſt, Becauſe I thought men of parts and abilities, as they would look upon the piece to be weak, feeble, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate, and to deſerve no anſwer, ſo their time was better imployed then to ſpare it to ſuch a work.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Secondly, Leſt any on the other hand, out of ignorance ſhould think it unanſwerable, as I hear many that cry it up, who are ready to miſ judge, that our ſilence gives conſent thereto.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Thirdly, Becauſe moſt of his Arguments (I perceive) are ſuch as I have lately ſeen in pieces long ſince publiſht, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the anſwer of him doth anſwer others of the ſame ſtrain.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Fourthly, Becauſe the ſtanding for this truth, for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of Infant Church-ſeed in the covenant, is a ſprig of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration work, as the holy Ghoſt witneſſeth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.9.
<pb facs="tcp:168338:3"/> which yet is oppoſed by our diſſenting friends, I have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore uſed this Trowel with thoſe in <hi>Nehemiah</hi> 4.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Fiftly, And to let good men know there are a few names in <hi>Sardis,</hi> that have not defiled their garments, who are apt to think the contrary.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Sixthly, And to give a hand to pull them out that are fallen into Rivers: to reclaim their practice, by informing their judgements, or at leaſt to cauſe them to make a halt, and to go no further in error; but remember from whence they are fallen and repent.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Becauſe the name <hi>T. P.</hi> is lookt upon as the chief in this moiſt clymate, that bears away the bell; and therefore fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt to be anſwered, his name being ſo well known amongſt us, as alſo becauſe, though there hath been never ſo much ſaid, yet if it comes not forth as an Anſwer by name, there is but few that will vouchſafe to give it the reading. As if the moſt part of that judgement, were reſolved to act from implicite Faith, or to bolt out the truth, and ſhut out the light that ſhines, in ſo many choice and learned pieces that are publiſht, both touching the covenant and baptiſm.</p>
            <p>I cannot but think there are many cenſorious ſpirits who will be ready to ſmite with a reviling tongue; becauſe they are even ready to call the Maſter of the houſe <hi>Belzebub,</hi> much more therefore a mean ſervant. It is the common language of the children of Belial in theſe days, that if a man do but ſpeak a word for the Miniſtery, and ſervants of God, imployed in that work of double honor, as I am here neceſſitated to do, there goes a Prieſt-ridden fellow. All I ſhall ſay to ſuch, is to remember what <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of ſcoffing <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> Gal. 4.29, 30.</p>
            <p>The ſpirit by which his book was penned, I ſhall ſpeak lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to it here, becauſe occaſion will be offered to meet with it ſo fully in the Anſwer; onely this I will ſay, that from
<pb facs="tcp:168338:4"/> one end to the other, I have not met with one Scripture by him quoted, but hath been moſt ſhamefully abuſed, either in Explication, or Application; and if that large ſtory of his experience were right, vvhich he ſpeaks of in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle, it is ſtrange that a man ſo pretending ſhould not hit the right mark of any one Text. God direct us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand his Minde and Will: that ſo vve may knovv the truth, and hold it faſt in erring days, vvhen there are ſo many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful counter-truths abroad, that Chriſtians may not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake the one for the other, and run up and dovvn like <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> Foxes, in days of heat, when ſo much combuſtible ſtubble is abroad, to ſet all in flames. Methinks the moſt acceptable news in theſe Athenian days, to all good men, would be, to hear our fallen Brethren reclaimed, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting Proteſtant friends united in one Faith, under one Lord, in one Baptiſm: That hearts and hands being joyned againſt the common and publike enemy of the truth, the work of our Generation may the better go on and proſper.</p>
            <p>Diviſion and diſſention is but the Divels bone of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and ſtrife caſt amongſt Brethren; who well knows that nothing is more like to obſtruct Gods work in every generation. <hi>As that wiſe man tells us, how can two walk together except they are agreed?</hi> When perſons are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, in heads, and hearts; be ſure they will fall ſhort of the end. Our Lord Chriſt himſelf well knew the danger of ſuch Doctrines, when he applyes it to Kingdomes, and Families, and tells us they cannot ſtand.</p>
            <p>Look upon that Image of the four Monarchies in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> the ſecond, that hath ruled the world. It is diviſion hath been their ruine, when Gold, Silver, Braſs, Iron, and Clay have been mixt. It is the glory of the Fifth
<pb facs="tcp:168338:4"/> Monarchy, that ſhall ſtand as long as the world laſts, that it is but one ſtone cut out: and then it is like to be a ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling one, when the other ſhall be Babel'd, being ſmote on the divided Toes and Feet.</p>
            <p>Look into <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Savoy, the ſtreets of the great City,</hi> are not the Witneſſes killing there, that are to lye dead three days and a half? If that be ſo, ſtand upon your Watch-Towers, Chriſtians; and ſee <hi>Romes</hi> doom approaching: the expectation of their Iſles is mounted, to behold what God is a doing; let all the earth keep ſilence before him, the hope of <hi>Iſrael</hi> is at the doors: and e're long <hi>Abrahams</hi> Covenant will be the voice of the people. Thoſe that divide here, ſo as to caſt off this Covenant, are undone, and ruined; thoſe that u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite upon Covenant-terms, and own the Conditions, are, and ſhall be as Mount-Sionn, ever removed.</p>
            <p>Look toward the Wilderneſs: [How goodly are thy Tents O <hi>Jacob!</hi> and ſee the Church coming out leaning upon her beloved: there will not be an Infant left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde.

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:168338:6"/> ſaid; the way to put a ſtop to ſuch perſons, is to lay open their folly: and to ſhew the world, that their accuſations are falſe: this courſe did <hi>Moſes</hi> take with thoſe Egyptian Prieſts.</p>
               <p>The perſon with whom I am to deal in this Reply, hath ſhewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in Print, to come in the number of thoſe falſe accuſers, declaring to the world that our practice of Infant-Baptiſm doth fight againſt and deſtroy, ſeven fundamental points in the Chriſtian Religion; by which we may ſee his Charge mounts very high, and either he muſt make it good, or elſe he will fall under the guilt of his own folly and blindneſs, if not wickedneſs ſo to affirm.

               <p>Theſe are the days wherein <hi>men heap to themſelves teachers,</hi> having itching ears; for what is writ in this book, called <hi>The Doctrine of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſms,</hi> is no more then what long ſince he publikely taught, as may be gathered from his own words. But doubtleſs, if a man ſhould deſire an account of his Miniſterial Authority, by which he entitles himſelf a laborer; it would appear to be more from men then God; and that he was never ordained, to ſuch a work: But is rather in the number of <hi>Jeroboams</hi> Prieſts, who was made of <hi>the loweſt of the people,</hi> in the fulleſt extent of that word.</p>

So on the other hand, ſhould this Doctor of dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping convert a Heathen or Jew, and plunge him, when he ſhould have onely poured the water on him after the Primitive practice, yet the baptiſm ſtands in force ſtill; yea, though the Author ſo dipping be no true, real, but a pretended Miniſter; as <hi>Ziphora</hi>'s circumciſing ſtood in force though ſhe were a defective Adminiſtrator; and this is the general ſenſe of Proteſtant Authors; that thoſe Children or perſons that receive Popiſh baptiſm by their Prieſts after they are really con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to the Faith of Chriſt, ought not again to be baptized: and yet we ſee they are as ignorant as heathens: by what therefore is ſaid, it is apparent the forementioned Doctrine is not to be extended to all alike, and though it be an undoubted truth amongſt ſuch as preach to the heathens in <hi>New-England,</hi> or to ſuch amongſt our ſelves as are yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized, yet it is not therefore a ſutable Doctrine to ſuch as have been before baptized either there or elſewhere.

               <p>All which being laid down as ſo many Eſſentials, if any one be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the baptiſm in his ſenſe is made null and void: we are therefore come to examine theſe ſeveral heads, and firſt the Miniſter or Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrator: p. 6. preaching Diſciples <hi>go ye therefore,</hi> but when he afterwards comes to explain his meaning, who they are, he ſpeaks thus, That Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciple that can bring down God to the ſoul, and the ſoul up to God, is a lawful Miniſter of baptiſm.] I ſhall therefore a little ſearch into this unheard of qualification, according to the place by him quoted; firſt the perſons ſpoken of, had an immediate Commiſſion from Chriſt. <hi>Go ye therefore:</hi> Secondly, The perſons ſent were Apoſtles; men in Office, men of Gifts, for the work; <hi>Go teach all Nations, baptiſing,</hi> ſuch they were that baptized in a way of office, power, and authority; And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe, therefore every man that undertakes to preach by a Gift, either occaſionally or intentively not having any Commiſſion or Call thereto may baptize: is this any lawful deduction, or rather is it not the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:168338:7"/> way to deſtroy the Miniſtry? by this rule, if there be twenty in the Church of which this Author is a labourer, or Miniſter, that can preach (or talk rather) as well as himſelf, they ſhall therefore take his power of adminiſtring theſe Seals out of his hands. When as both he, and they are bound to deſiſt from any ſuch actions until they are duly and ſolemnly admitted into an office that capacities them for the work; And the contrary is condemned by the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. <hi>Are all Apoſtles, are all Prophets, are all Paſtors and Teachers,</hi> &amp;c. And therefore God hath ſet every member in the Church to be uſeful to the body in his due place: as are the members of the natural body, and not one to intrude upon the other. Conſider further</p>
               <p>Secondly, If that be all the qualification required for the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Sacraments before mentioned, then may a woman be a lawful adminiſtrator; for though the title of preaching Diſciples reaches onely to the Males: yet that kind of explanation will reach fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males. What if ſuch a one as <hi>Priſcilla,</hi> who was a Diſciple, ſhould amongſt many of her own Sex, be an inſtrument to convert ſome to the Faith? I hope it cannot be denyed but ſhe brings down God to the ſoul, is it therefore lawful for her to baptize? there muſt therefore ſuch a reſtriction be put upon the words, as confines them to perſons in office, or elſe we are like to come to a ſtrange kind of Reformation at laſt. But indeed this kind of qualification, though the full current of the words are rough and harſh; yet may it well ſuit with their practice, for though they lay much weight upon the thing it ſelf, called <hi>the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance:</hi> yet are they very looſe in this which he calls an Eſſential, namely the Adminiſtrator, for if the Paſtor or Officer be abſent, or ſick (but uſually they have neither) if the people do but deſire ſuch a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to baptize and give the Sacraments, although it be but for a day, this is lookt upon as a ſufficient warrant to make ſuch a perſon fit for the work, and thus the practice thereof ſhall run in the vein of Diſciple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, one baptiſing the other, which is expreſly againſt the very nature of the Ordinance, and all Scripture examples and preſidents. Look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt a Prophet, a man ſent by God, the Diſciples of Chriſt, all by himſelf called and Commiſſioned: and ſo they were to adminiſter baptiſm in a way of Office to the end of the world, and not onely the Apoſtles, but their ſucceſſors alſo, Paſtors, Teachers. Which are as well given to the Church, as the Apoſtles, Prophers, &amp; Evangeliſts, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11. and do and ſhall continue ſo long as the Commiſſion remains till the worlds end: had it been given equally alike to all the Church Diſciples, he would not have ſingled out perſons in Office: ſo <hi>Philip</hi>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:168338:8"/> an Evangeliſt called by a voice from Heaven, <hi>Ananias</hi> called by a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from God <hi>Act</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But Baptiſm is an Ordinance that belongs to the Church, and it is in their power to give the keys as they ſhall judge fit.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Church can do nothing againſt the truth, but for the truth: nothing without the rule. If granted that all the males have their votes, yet the adminiſtration of the keys lies in the Office or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels power, for adminiſtration of the Seals <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.12. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44.5, 11. Thirdly, Conſider yet further how ſhall we know who is enabled to bring down God to the ſoul, and the ſoul up to God? Converſion is an act of Grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not in the Creatures power; and though a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter may be truly called to the work by God and man: yet we know the word may not work for many years, but like ſeed, may lie hid in the ground, yet, muſt not this man baptize any, by this rule, though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by others, becauſe the ſucceſs of his own labour lies hid, ſo as that he is not able to ſay he hath been inſtrumental in that kind to the ſouls of his hearers.</p>
               <p>In pag. 7. He ſtrikes down our Miniſtry at a blow, and indeed oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth diametrically what before he affirmed: <q rend="margQuotes">That though a Miniſter do preach ſo as to convert, and bring down God to the ſoul, yet if he be ignorant of this practice of dippping, which he calls the true way of diſpenſing the Ordinance and a fundamental: he is no juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Miniſter, that in ſtead of dipping ſhall ſprinkle carnal ignorant Children.</q> By which we may ſee that the foundation of a true Mini<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtry in his ſenſe, lies more in the water then in converſion: For he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies any true Goſpel Miniſtry, but thoſe of his own ſtamp. So that when the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> affi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ms the truth of his Miniſtry was evidenced by that Seal, <hi>the ſeal of my Apoſtleſhip are ye in the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.2. This Author would have it run The ſeal of a juſtifiable Miniſter, <hi>are ye in the water:</hi> and thus he deſtroys not onely the preſent Miniſtry of Chriſt in this world: but alſo that of the Apoſtles themſelves. For as I ſhall afterwards prove, they were all ſtrangers to this practice of dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, their manner being by pouring water on the ſubject: If Jeſus Chriſt ſhall then juſtifie our preſent Miniſtry in ſealing their labors, it is too bold an act for a man of ſuch a feeble practice to condemn them. Thus the Reader may ſee his reſult on both hands; when the Argument is brought againſt our practice: then no man is a luſtifiable Miniſter, except he know how to plunge, and doth ſo practice, when he comes to ſhew what a lawful adminiſtrator is in his ſenſe, then he that can bring down the ſoul to God: ſo that we may from hence ſee, what
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:168338:8"/> a Babel Miniſtry this man of contradictions would ſet up in the world: If I ſhould here ask the Author of this new Baptiſm, under what Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry he was converted, no doubt but his anſwer would be very favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to thoſe, whom he here oppoſeth. Remember then your third Doctrine; That 'tis the diſpoſition of ſuch, that have the beginning of ſaving light, to deſire more; and that from them whom God hath ſpoken to their ſouls by: Or elſe you may queſtion whether you have any light at all. But becauſe 'tis to ſpeak a word for the truth, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing error, let me therefore return him Talion Law.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He that takes the Covenant of Grace for a Covenant of Works, can be no Goſpel Miniſter, becauſe ignorant of the Goſpel in the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals thereof.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He that affirms a Believer at one time may be under two Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of Works and Grace, he is no Miniſter of the Goſpel.</p>

               <p>THe ſecond Eſſential he ſo calls in this Doctrine of Baptiſmes, is the manner thereof, by Dipping, not ſprinkling. To prove which, though he ſay the word is rendred to Dip, Dous, Drown, or Plunge, in this he ſpeaketh with a hood-wink'd underſtanding, and muſt ſhake hands with the Roman Tribe, that acts from an implicite faith, belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving as learned men tels him; though yet he can hardly afford them a good word, or charitable cenſure. As for the place he brings, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 5.14. where the Prophet bids <hi>Naaman go waſh in</hi> Jordan <hi>ſeven times, and he dipt himſelf. Anſwer,</hi> Though waſhing is ſometimes by dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping; yet not alwaies, yea but ſeldom. A man may properly be ſaid to waſh himſelf in a River, though he only dips in his hand, and caſts water about him, which is moſt frequent and uſual, both in our pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, and acceptation of the word, either in our vulgar, or in Scripture dialect: Were a man to waſh his face or head, muſt he needs dip it; and ſo of any other part, or the whole body: But let us ſearch the Scriptures, <hi>Mark</hi> 7.4. <hi>Except they waſh they eat not;</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> 11.30. <hi>They marvail at Chriſt, that he had not firſt waſht before dinner:</hi> Is any man ſo void of reaſon to think, that before the Phariſees ſate down, they plunged themſelves: And Chriſt, who well knew what the word to baptize, or waſh, ſignified, gives them ſuch an anſwer as relates to the powring out of water, ſo waſhing onely the outſide of things, <hi>verſe</hi> 39.</p>
               <p>Had their cups and platters, tables and beds, been dipt, and ſo waſht, then had inſide, outſide, and every ſide, been waſht. The word then hath a promiſcuous acceptation, ſome times taken one way, ſome times another; as <hi>Sidnam</hi> clears this, <hi>Budeus, Scapula, Paſor, Grotius,</hi> do give the ſenſe of the word: Therefore to no purpoſe is this unlearned Authors Appeal to the Greek, Latin, and Engliſh Churches: Though yet, 'tis conſiderable, that he ſhould acknowledge ſuch as Churches, whom his words and practice do ſo much cry down; therefore I doubt his charity is much of the ſame nature with thoſe of the late fifth Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy; who though they would uſe the word of Proteſtant Churches, yet they did look upon them but as the outworks of Anti-Chriſt, which were firſt to be ſtorm'd: For there is ſcarce a Book extant of the

               <p>
                  <hi rend="margQuotes">Secondly, he tells us that the phraſe in which Baptiſm is rendered, doth uſually, and neceſſarily import ſuch a thing, And therefore when mention is made of Baptizing, 'tis commonly tranſlated, in, or into, and therefore ſuits moſt with dipping, and not that prepoſition [with] which ſuits moſt with ſprinkling; and when our tranſlation tells us that <hi>Iohn Baptized with water,</hi> he would correct it <hi>within water;</hi> and inſtead of <hi>ye ſhall be baptized with the holy Ghoſt and with fire,</hi> it ſhould be rendred <hi>in the holy ſpirit and in fire.</hi>

                  </gap>7. the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> who very well knew what was meant by the word Baptize, interprets it, by <hi>Ioell</hi> 2.31 <hi>to be the powring out of</hi> the ſpirit propheſied of. And thus when Chriſts tells them of their being Baptized with the ſpirit, it appears to be meant of the ſpirits pouring out, ſo that from hence its evident, that <hi>Iohns</hi> Baptiſm was by pouring out water, and not plunging into water, or elſe it would not have been ſo conjunctively plac'd with the the manner of the ſpirits Baptiſm: <hi>Iohn truely Baptized with water, but ye ſhall be Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed with the holy Ghoſt.</hi> For as the pouring out the holy Ghoſt was the true Baptiſm of the Spirit, ſo <hi>Iohn</hi> truely Baptizing with water, was by powreing it out alſo; let but any <hi>Engliſhman</hi> reade it that knowes but how to make ſence of what he reads, &amp; it muſt of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie gives a daſh to all their plunging; Let therefore ſuch as have been deluded into ſo groundleſs a practice conſider it and repent thereof.</p>
               <p>A ſecond paralell inſtance to confute this practice of dipping, is that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:168338:10"/> of <hi>Iſraels being Baptized in the clouds &amp; in the Sea</hi> 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 10. which by <hi>Paul</hi> the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as before <hi>Peter</hi> was of the <hi>Iews, is called a Baptiſm:</hi> and by what principle of reaſon or conſcience, can any man think that <hi>Iſrael</hi> was plung'd into either cloud or ſea, when the word of God tels us <hi>they marcht through the ſea upon drie land: Exo:</hi> 14: 22. the waters being divided, yea <hi>Davids</hi> relating to this very march of <hi>Iſrael</hi> Pſalm the 77.15.17. tells us that this Baptiſm (which <hi>Paul</hi> ſo calls, in which beleevers and their ſeed were Baptized) was by pouring out water, and not plunging into water: For thus the word runs, <hi>the clouds poured out water.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If men therfore will not harden their hearts againſt the truth and blind their owne eyes, here is light enough to ſhew us what is meant by this word Baptize; the Authoritie of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> both eminent <hi>Apoſtles</hi> bearing witneſs to this truth: &amp; yet wee muſt be deluded from the truth by ignorant men, againſt not onely the very light of nature, but of Scriptures alſo. As for that other Prepoſition example, which he brings in that page of baptizing in the Wilderneſs, and in <hi>Jordan,</hi> he tels us it would be improper to render it, with the Wilderneſs and with <hi>Jordan,</hi> and therfore would urge it to be as improper in that other place.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, the Reader may from hence alſo gather how ſadly fit this man is for a miniſter, who to make our practice ſpeake nonſence, doth not himſelfe know what belongs to a ſenſe. For becauſe the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition <hi>[with]</hi> is by us maintained proper, when it relates to the matter, or manner, therefore he would have it alſo as proper when it relates to the place: as if I ſhould ſay, Maſter <hi>Patient</hi> hath baptized with the mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pool with <hi>Dublin,</hi> for in the milpool in <hi>Dublin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. In Pag. 9. his next place he brings to maintain his dipping is that of <hi>Paul.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 10. already touched on, they were all Baptized to <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Cloud, and in the ſea, not with the clouds and with the ſea.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw:</hi> Which is moſt proper to ſay, <hi>Iſrael were Baptized by pouring out water from the cloud, and by ſprinkling from the ſea,</hi> or to ſay, <hi>Iſrael was Baptized by plunging into the cloud,</hi> and into the ſea, for then they muſt be all over-whelmed with both. And David in the place before-quoted tells us it was done by pouring out water; was it improper to ſay, <hi>Iſrael</hi> was Baptized in the ſea, when they were in the ſea? for though God wrought a miracle to divide the waters, that <hi>Iſrael</hi> might march upon dry ground, yet was it in the Sea. As when a man hath been in a ſhoure of raine, Is it improper to ſay he hath been in the rain, becauſe it is not proper to ſay he hath been dipt into a cloud? I ſhall therefore refer this to the conſideration of the moſt
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:168338:10"/> judicious of that Judgment (of which, there are many.) What ground of Reaſon there can be for ſuch a conſtruction as is made of that place, by this Author, and ſhall alſo leave that place, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.4, 5. to be thought of as an example, That when the <hi>Egyptians</hi> marched into the Sea, they were baptized in his ſence, <hi>i. e.</hi> Dipt, dowſt, and drowned, but not Gods <hi>Iſrael;</hi> take heed therefore of your too eager purſuit of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Seed; who as they were then, ſo ſtill are baptized by pouring or ſprinkling.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, In <hi>Page</hi> 10. the next place he brings for dipping, is in <hi>Acts</hi> 8.38, 39. <hi>Philip</hi> baptized the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> they being both in the water, he dipt the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> as <hi>John</hi> did Jeſus, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.16.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> And much at one, that is, the Eunuch was as much plunged as Chriſt was plunged; for they were neither of them ſo baptized. It hath been already proved, that <hi>Johns</hi> manner of baptizing, was not by plunging, but pouring out water; and therefore that Text, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.6. ſtands for a cypher in this particular. A man may as properly be ſaid to go downe into the water, and come up out of the water, though not wet-ſhod, as if he had been dipt all over: So was <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Sea properly, and yet not dipt; beſides, <hi>Philip</hi> was as much in the Water as the Eunuch, and in that conſtruction they muſt be both plunged; but not a word is here of the <hi>mode</hi> of Baptiſm, onely he baptized him, the manner muſt be pickt out of other Scriptures, which may be eaſily gathered from what hath been already ſpoken: There may be other Reaſons alſo given, why it could not be by dipping, as that the Eunuch was upon a journey travelling homeward; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neither he, nor <hi>Philip,</hi> provided with garments ſuitable for ſuch a work, it being accidental to them both: For if it be a Goſpel Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, it muſt not be done, they being both naked; for ſo it would have been an action of no good report, contrary to <hi>Pauls</hi> rule. And indeed, take it in the moſt ſerious manner, as now practiſed yet there is no ſhew of carriage or deportment ſuitable to the Majeſty of the Goſpel of Chriſt, which may eaſily appear to any ſober Chriſtian, whoſe eyes are not darkned by ignorance or blinde zeal: For what gravity can there be for a Miniſter, who is Gods Ambaſſador to the World, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. to put off his ſhooe's and ſtockings, and to lead a Gentlewoman by the hand into a River, and throw her on her back? Is this a deportment fit for Ambaſſadors that come from God? whoſe holineſs is ſuch, that will not permit a Woman to be uncovered or unvailed in the Church, and ſhall we think then he will own ſuch inhumanities? Methinks the very naming hereof ſhould be a ſufficient
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:168338:11"/> confutation, which is enough to make a modeſt face to bluſh. Alſo conſidering, that either Subject or Adminiſtrator, and perhaps both, may be of ſo tender, weak, and feeble conſtitution, as they are not able to undergo the cold. Many ſuch conſiderations falls in, that were it practiſed amongſt Heathens, that do by nature the things contained in the Law; that very light amongſt them would condemn it.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, He argues in <hi>Page</hi> 10. from <hi>Johns</hi> Baptiſm, his work being to Baptize, he remained near <hi>Jordan,</hi> and afterwards at <hi>Enon</hi> near <hi>Salem,</hi> becauſe there was much Water in that place. <hi>Ergo,</hi> He bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by dipping.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It hath been already proved from <hi>Mark</hi> 18. with <hi>Acts</hi> 1.3. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.17. which relates to <hi>Joel</hi> the ſecond, That <hi>Johns</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm was not by dipping, but pouring out Water; and therefore this cannot be the reaſon why he choſe that place, namely, Becauſe there were many Waters to dip. Other Reaſons muſt be therefore given, as, That becauſe the work of baptiſing a whole Region was very great; and <hi>John</hi> not onely baptiſing himſelf, but very likely, having made Diſciples which he taught more immediately, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.1, 2. <hi>John</hi> 4.1, 2. <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.2, 3. <hi>Luke</hi> 7.18. as Chriſt did his Diſciples: He alſo might ordain and appoint them to the work, that ſo when the whole multitude of people came together, they might have each a ſhare of the work, and conveniency of place accordingly, becauſe there were many waters, when other parts of the Country were very ſcarce thereof; as not onely Hiſtory, but Scripture mention; track <hi>Iſraels</hi> march from <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Surely, had this Author of the Doctrine of Baptiſms lived in <hi>Spain,</hi> or in many parts of <hi>Zona-torida,</hi> where they ſell Water as we do Beer, not having enough to drown a man in a Country; he would have been of a more ſober judgment.

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> What ſtrange Hieroglyphicks doth this Author make in the Water, by dipping? What ſtretcht inferences to make the Scripture anſwer his fancy? let's try the places. If Chriſt calls his afflictions a Baptiſm, doth it therefore follow, That all Believers ſhould repreſent it by plunging? We know that many Chriſtians never meet with ſuch afflictions; and ſuch a practice to be ſo plunged, would be a greater affliction then ever befel them; and the place implies this, to be in deep waters, is an affliction; or, would this new Doctor have Believers do themſelves a miſchief, to repreſent Chriſts afflictions: Which of neceſſity, thouſands muſt do by this practice of dipping. It is no hard matter to give ſeveral inſtances hereof.</p>
               <p>Secondly, What ſhould ſuch do to repreſent thoſe afflictions of Chriſt, that have not water enough in a Country, except they ſhould make deep Ponds or Veſſels of purpoſe. Did ever the Martyrs in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> days, or the Primitive perſecutions, take that courſe, and yet no doubt but they were as much baptized into Chriſts death and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, as ever this Author could be, though with his practice he ſhould give his body to be burnt, to juſtifie the ſame. Therefore, let the judicious but impartially judge what ſtrange doctrines this Labor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, for dowſing, brings. <hi>What though</hi> David <hi>cried to the Lord out of the depths;</hi> yet his head ſtil kept above water: unleſs he will affirms, that the promiſe in the place, by himſelf quoted <hi>Iſai.</hi> 43.2. was not made good unto him, <hi>[When thou paſſeſt through the water, it ſhall not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow thee.]</hi> And though afflictions ſhall never quite overflow a childe of God, yet by this doctrine the body muſt be dipt all over: A ſtrange reſemblance!</p>
               <p>The like we may ſay to that of 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. by which he would prove, That Baptiſm is a figure of Salvation, though yet, it cannot be by dipping under water, becauſe the Apoſtle calls it a like figure to the Ark: But the Ark was never under water, but always floating, and ſo the perſons that were in the Ark; therefore if Baptiſm be a like figure, then it needs no going under water for a ſignification: For had the Ark been dowſt under water, the ſignification had been loſt, or at leaſt not ſo clear. By this therefore, we may take the hint of an other Argument, to prove dipping under water, not to be the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture way of baptiſing. Thus we may ſee how fully and apparently even his own Scriptures, makes againſt both his Book and practice.</p>
               <p>As to that other place, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.16. it is quite beſides the buſineſs; for it doth not prove Baptiſm to be a figure of Salvation: <hi>onely he that believes and is baptized, i. e.</hi> obeys the Goſpel, <hi>ſhall be ſaved.</hi> Thus
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:168338:12"/> then his ſecond Eſſentiall of dipping hath been examined with all his ten arguments: upon which this Author of the doctrine of Baptiſmes doth build the whole ſtreſs and fabrick of dipping-grown perſons with ſoe much heat and confidence, and ſuch ſlighting contempt of his oppoſers, and upon the whole reſult it appears but as a bubble quickly broken, <hi>Ergo</hi> dipping is no Eſſentiall.</p>

Let us therefore review thoſe primitive and 'Apoſtolicall examples.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw:</hi> The Baptiſm of <hi>Iohn,</hi> none will denie, but his Baptiſm and Miniſterie was from God, and ſo a Goſpell-Baptizm: did the perſons he Baptized give this Account? the contrarie is moſt evident, and that they claimed a right to that ordinance as being <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed to whom the covenant was made: therefore when the <hi>Phariſees</hi> came to be Baptized, who lived not as <hi>Abrahams</hi> Children, hee turns them back with a reproof, <hi>think not to ſay within your ſelves you have Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham to your Father: for you are a generation of Vipers.</hi> Had not the reſt been receaved upon that conſideration as <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed; the reproof had not been ſuitable: but no mention is made of their diſtinct know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg in the myſtery of the Trinitie.</p>
               <p>Secondly had this been an eſſentiall, then was <hi>Iohns</hi> Baptizm quite null, and the Apoſtles alſo before Chriſts death: for the third perſon was not ſo eminently known nor ſent, becauſe Chriſt was not then glorified, yea <hi>Iohns</hi> diſciples never heard whether there were any holy Ghoſt, therefore how could they beleeve in him (and ſo confeſs, him) ſo diſtinctly and eminently? <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14.</p>
               <p>This further appears by conſidering the commiſſion it ſelfe, and the practice of the diſciples thereupon: the words of the Commiſſion are, <hi>goe teach all nations</hi> &amp;c. <hi>teaching them to obſerve whatever I command
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:168338:13"/> you.</hi> In which ſomething is to be taught before, ſomthing after Baptiſm, now that which is to be taught before is ſo much as capacifies them <hi>to be diſciples,</hi> for ſo our oppoſits give the Rendition of the words, <hi>goe diſciple all nations.</hi> As a Child then may be a diſciple when he firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to learne his A. B. C. ſo may a Chriſtian bee a diſciple of Chriſt without ſuch a high pitch of Knowledg into the myſtery of the Trinitie. For without all peradventure, the Apoſtles themſelves were ignorant thereof though Baptized, when Chriſt firſt called them, and were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards taught further by degrees: for the Scripture tells us they were diſciples before they knew how to pray <hi>Luke.</hi> 11.1.2.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That this is no Eſſentiall, further appears, if we view the practice of the Apoſtles after Chriſts aſcenſion; as for inſtance, that place <hi>Acts</hi> 2. where ſo many thouſands were Baptized together, can any reaſonable man think that they all gave ſuch a diſtinct Accompt of their faith into the perſons of the Trinitie, and that in one day. <hi>The</hi> like alſo in the Eunuch <hi>Acts</hi> the 8. what Accompts did he give, but onely I beleeve that Ieſus Chriſt is the ſonn of God, and ſurely had there been more needfull, when he asked that queſtion, what hinders? <hi>Philip</hi> would not have Baptized him before he had given a fuller ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt into all the perſons of the Trinitie, For to what purpoſe had it been, when his Baptiſm had been null for want thereof; the like inſtance alſo is that of <hi>Simon Magus Acts,</hi> 8. then <hi>Simon</hi> himſelfe beleeved alſo and was Baptized, and yet afterwards hee appeared to be ſoe Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the holy Ghoſt, that he would have bought the gifts thereof with money, yea were this to be decided by the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> themſelves there would not be one in twentie rightly Baptized, ſuppoſing (though not granted) their practice to be true, For how <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="1">1. The firſt Family Text he quotes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is that of <hi>Lydea, Acts</hi> 16.14, 15. <hi>And a certain woman named</hi> Lydea, <hi>a ſeller of Purple, of he City of</hi> Thiatira, <hi>which worſhipped God, heard us, whoſe heart the Lord opened that ſhe attended, &amp;c. And when ſhe was baptized and her houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:168338:14"/> ſhe beſought us, ſaying, If ye have judged me faithful to the Lord, come into my houſe, and ſhe conſtrained us.</hi> Which Family Mr. <hi>Patient</hi> ſaith, were all Believers, <hi>Verſe</hi> 40. which <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Sylas</hi> went to viſit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The conſideration of the words preceding the Text, and the ſeveral circumſtances, will give a clear light to finde out the truth, by him (and many Scribes of a late edition of that party) obſcured and darkned.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The perſons that were met together, were onely women.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Of all thoſe Women met, we finde onely <hi>Lydea</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Upon her converſion, we finde her houſhold baptized, and that at the ſame time: By which it is apparent, that ſhe took with her, her family to the place of worſhip; for thus the words run, <hi>And when ſhe was baptized, and her houſhold, ſhe beſought us, ſaying, If you have judged me faithful to the Lord, come with me, &amp;c.</hi> Both ſhe and her houſhold, were baptized before they went home; by which alſo, we may very lawfully gather,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there were no men at the meeting.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That therefore thoſe Brethren afterwards mentioned, could not be then at that time converted, becauſe, had there been men, and they wrought upon, the Holy Ghoſt would not have overſlipt them, to take notice onely of the Female: Therefore it is evident, That thoſe Brethren ſpoken of, <hi>Verſe</hi> 40. were either ſome of the Family after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards converted, or ſome other of the City, then met at her houſe, which were after <hi>Lydea</hi>'s converſion, wrought upon, becauſe we finde <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Sylas</hi> were committed to priſon; and it is likely, it was upon that converting work, which the Goſpel made amongſt them, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But that thoſe Brethren, were converted at that time, when ſhe and her houſhold were baptized, is againſt the expreſs Letter of the Text, as any obſervant Reader may ſee. This Text therefore makes againſt Mr. <hi>Patient;</hi> for if <hi>Lydea</hi> and her houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold were baptized, when we finde onely <hi>Lydea</hi> converted: And if by houſe, is meant Children, as I ſhall afterwards prove it is, then it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>greeable to the very minde of <hi>God,</hi> to ſay, That her believing gave her Children aright to Baptiſm, becauſe we do not finde any that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, but her, and yet we finde all her houſhold baptized. Thus
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:168338:15"/> then this place breaks forth with much clear light, diſpelling thoſe foggs of error that ſcribbling pens have caſt upon it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The next place hee brings is the Jaylor and his houſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. <hi>who rejoyced in God with all his houſe, [hee beleeving]</hi> For ſo the words are truly rendred, by which it doth not appear the whole houſe beleeved, but the whole houſe rejoyced, and yet, both he and his whole houſe were Baptized. Secondly 'tis obſervable, the exhortation given the Jaylor runs in the very ſtrains of <hi>Abrahams</hi> covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. <hi>walke before me, And I will bee thy God and the God or thy ſeed;</hi> ſo here, <hi>beleeve, and thou ſhalt be ſaved and thy houſe,</hi> ſo <hi>Acts</hi> 2. <hi>when they were prickt in heart, as this Jaylor was, Repent and be Baptized, the promiſe is to you and your Children:</hi> ſo here <hi>verſe</hi> 33. <hi>hee was Baptized, he and all that were of him.</hi> A fuller expreſſion could not well be uſed, to ſet out his Children by, who may properly be ſaid to bee of their Parents, and none but they. Therefore, if the Jaylor and all that were of him were Baptized, when onely the Jaylor beleeved, though all rejoyc'd, then he and his Children were Baptized; unleſs any man can be ſo unreaſonable as to ſay, that thoſe that were of him were not Children; which to affirme, will but rather diſcover weakeneſs then Eclipſe the truth.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, A third example which holds forth a clearer light to the preceding, is that of <hi>Zacheus, Luke</hi> 9 who was <hi>a Gentile-Publican,</hi> yet upon Chriſts calling him, hee uſeth this argument, <hi>to day I muſt abide at thy houſe,</hi> and in <hi>verſe</hi> 9. <hi>this day is ſalvation come to this houſe, For as much as hee alſo is a Son of Abraham:</hi> In which word <hi>[alſo]</hi> the very covenant of grace made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed is confirmed to him and his houſe though a Gentile, that had no rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed by birth, yet, <hi>thou alſo though a Gentile, art the ſon of</hi> Abraham; <hi>and therefore ſalvation is come to thy houſe.</hi> Note<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy are the collections of faithfull <hi>Sydenham,</hi> from this place, whoſe little peece hath made their water-workes totter, and remains not onely unanſwered, but unanſwereable, though the ſpattering of a ſcratching pen hath given a late attempt to little purpoſe. His collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are theſe, firſt, <hi rend="margQuotes">that aſſoon as <hi>Zacheus</hi> beleeved, Chriſt applyed <hi>Abrahams</hi> promiſe to his houſe; And it there had not been ſomething more in it, he would have ſaid onely, ſalvation is come to thee: For the ſpirit of God doth not put a ſyllable more in the Scriptures then is uſefull and neceſſarie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="margQuotes">Secondly Hee opens <hi>Abrahams</hi> covenant not onely to him, but his houſe, and argues the priviledg from his being a ſon of <hi>Abraham,</hi>
                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:168338:15"/> though a Gentile, ſhewing that <hi>Abrahams</hi> covenant hath as large an extent amongſt the Gentiles, as it had amongſt the Jews <hi>to a beleever and his ſeed;</hi> otherwiſe it had been enough to have ſaid ſalvation is come to thee: but to mention his houſe with himſelfe, and to bring them into the bleſſing, and give this as a reaſon, <hi>becauſe thou alſo art a ſon of Abraham,</hi> is as much as to ſay, that the priviledges of <hi>Abrahams</hi> covenant are the ſame to thee a Gentile and thy houſe, as they were to <hi>Iſaac,</hi> for as much as thou alſo art a ſon of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as well as hee. Now for Chriſt to ſpeak in this dialect, and to tell them of their houſhold and his favour to them, and that in the beginning of the Goſpells planting, and yet at the ſame time to exclude their infants from all outward ſignes of the promiſe, which they ever had in darkeſt dayes of Grace, is a ſtrange policie unſuitable to the ſimplicitie of the Goſpell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are ſuch plain examples, that I marvell what kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience men pretend to have, when they ſhut out the ſun that ſhines in theſe ſcriptures, and cry out they are full of darkneſs.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The next place and example brought by this Author, is the houſe of <hi>Stephanus,</hi> whom <hi>Paul</hi> Baptized; A Triumphant place ſo thought, to prove that there was no Children in thoſe houſes mentioned 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.6. <hi>chap</hi> 16.15. the words run thus; <hi>I beſeech you brethren you know the houſhold of</hi> Stephanus, <hi>that it is the firſt fruits of</hi> Achaia: <hi>that they have addicted themſelves to the miniſterie of the Saints; That yee ſubmit your ſelves to ſuch, and to every one that laboureth with us:</hi> where ſaith Maſter <hi>Patient,</hi> wee ſee they were all miniſters, and men that laboured with the Apoſtles, therefore not Babes or Children.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw:</hi> The Apoſtle doth not ſay they were all Miniſters, or ſuch as laboured in the word and doctrine, as he did himſelfe; But they are ſo ſaid to Miniſter, becauſe they addicted themſelves to the miniſtring to the Saints, in a way of <hi>Hoſpitalitie,</hi> for ſo the word is taken for releeving the Poor and ſo the ſame <hi>chap.</hi> refers to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. namely a free, liberall and charitable collection for the poor Saints: <hi>verſe</hi> 1.2.3. and 2 <hi>Cor</hi> 8.4. <hi>chap.</hi> 9.1. <hi>now as touching the Miniſtring to the Saints, 'tis ſuperfluous for me to write</hi> &amp;c. In which places the ſame word is uſed, as here in this example of <hi>Stephanus</hi> and his houſe, who addicted themſelves to the Miniſterie of the Saints. by which it appeares, that as the Apoſtle had boaſted of others in the former <hi>chap.</hi> ſo in this alſo hee commends the freeneſs and Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie of <hi>Stephanus;</hi> becauſe in ſuch actions there is much heart-ſinceritie to be ſeen, in entertaining poor Chriſtians, This being ſo,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:168338:16"/> Then tis no hard matter to know, who is meant by the houſe of <hi>Stephanus</hi> which <hi>Paul</hi> Baptized. For though the ſervants 'tis likely might be gracious, and full of love to poor Chriſtians, yet by the word <hi>houſe</hi> is property meant, Parents and Children, and 'tis very, unlikely, the ſervants of the houſe ſhould be ſo free and hoſpitable of their Maſters goods. And as for the Children, they were taken in by their Parents Actions and ſo the whole houſe is commended, For the hoſpitalitie of <hi>Stephanus</hi> and his yoakfellow, as 'tis uſuall in ſuch cauſes, to ſay, ſuch a houſe is noble and free, when 'tis meant onely of the heads and chief of the family, and theſe were the perſons that <hi>Paul</hi> preſſeth the Church to honour and eſteem; and to ſubmit to ſuch; And not to ſuch onely, but to every one alſo, that helpeth with us, and laboureth. But 'tis a ſtretcht inference to ſay, that becauſe his houſe addicted themſelves to the miniſtrie of the ſaints, therefore they were all preachers, and ſuch as laboured in the Goſpell, and the Church was to ſubmit themſelves to all the houſhold <hi>i. e.</hi> ſervants, and all as miniſters, therefore no Children. The like alſo the Apoſtle preſt them in the following verſe to ſubmit to <hi>Fortunatus</hi> and <hi>Achicus,</hi> who came with a ſeaſonable and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing releef and ſupply to their wants; <hi>therefore acknowledg ye them that are ſuch,</hi> verſe 18. <hi>i. e.</hi> ſuch who miniſter releef to Chriſtians in neceſſitie. So <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.15. 'tis ſaid that <hi>Peters Wives Mother miniſtred to Chriſt.</hi> Maſter <hi>Patient,</hi> ſurely will not be ſo far beſides himſelfe, to think that ſhe preacht to Chriſt, as a miniſter; from what then hath been alſo ſaid to this inſtance, 'tis abundantly clear to any ſober ſpirit who is willing to ſearch after truth, and not take things barely upon the count of Maſter <hi>Patients</hi> word. Our oppoſites have not ſo honeſtly quitted themſelves in al their writings in interpreting this text, to lay a ſnare, or decoy, to intrap, or intice people into the lake of error, by ſaying that here was none but Adult-beleevers in this houſe, when as the tenor of thoſe Scriptures hitherto which related to houſholds, hath ſtill run to the children upon the parents beleeving.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But how ſhall I know, whether, when the Scripture ſpeaks of houſe, there were any Children? for the word is not expreſt; they might be houſholds and yet no Children.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 'Tis the common way in finding out the mind of God in Scriptures to compare them, that ſo what is, darke in one, may be cleard by the other; And ſince the ſpirit of God at the firſt tender of the Goſpell, did delight to ſpeak to Jew and Gentile, in the Old
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:168338:16"/> Teſtament Dialect, as to ſay of <hi>Lydea,</hi> She and her Houſe, the Jaylor and his Houſe, <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his Houſe, <hi>Stephanus</hi> and his Houſe, <hi>Zacheus</hi> and his houſe; ſo <hi>Criſpus</hi> believed in God with all his houſe, the houſe of <hi>Ariſtobulus,</hi> the houſe of <hi>Narciſſus;</hi> it is as if he had ſaid, If you would know what I mean by this word <hi>houſe,</hi> then look back to my <hi>Firſt will and Teſtament;</hi> for what it was then, it is now. Therefore when upon review, we ſhall finde in the Old Teſtament, there were Children mentioned, and chiefly included; It will be then an undoubted truth to ſay, and maintain, That in all theſe houſes mentioned to be baptized, there were Children, which properly gave the denomination, and they all baptized whileſt little ones, upon the Belief or Covenant-right of their Parents. See <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.3. <hi>In thee ſhall all the families of the Earth be bleſſed:</hi> Who are ſo properly the Family as Children? <hi>Chap.</hi> 30.30. <hi>And when ſhall I provide for my own houſe alſo?</hi> Who was that houſe that <hi>Jacob</hi> was bound to look after, and provide for, but his Wife and Children. And <hi>Chap.</hi> 45.18, 19. <hi>Then ſaid</hi> Pharaoh, <hi>Say unto thy Brethren, take your Father, and your Houſhold, and come unto me.</hi> And <hi>Verſe</hi> 19 it is explained to be heir little ones, Wives, and Fathers. So <hi>Num.</hi> 3.15. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.5. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24.15. So the Apoſtle, <hi>He that provides not for his own houſe, i. e.</hi> His Children, <hi>is worſe then an Infidel, and hath denied the Faith,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.8. What denying the Faith can this be, for ſuch as profeſs Chriſt, if it be not the Faith of that Covenant of Grace, into which, Believers and Profeſſing-Chriſtians with their Seed, are admitted? The neglect of a Heathen-Parent, in not providing for his Children, cannot be called a denying the Faith, but the denying the Law of Nature.

               <p>Now then to ſum up all, the premiſſes conſidered, and that upon the advantage the Spirit of God puts into our hands, in explaining what is meant by the word <hi>houſe,</hi> himſelf, who is a better Expoſitor, then Mr. <hi>Patient,</hi> or any elſe; We ſee the whole Catalogue, or Cloud of Family-Witneſſes and Examples, in Scripture, do give in their Light and Teſtimony to <hi>Abrahams</hi> Infant-ſeed. And that when the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſpeaks of Houſholds baptized, it is meant Parents and Children; and when a Maſter of a Family was converted, and became the ſon of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as <hi>Zacheus,</hi> though a Gentile, his Seed, or Houſe alſo, were taken viſibly into Covenant, <hi>Luke</hi> 10 3, 6. So that by this time, we ſee the vanity, and ſelf-confidence of this Author, to ſpeak ſuch bitter words of Gall and Wormwood, as he doth in <hi>page</hi> 23. againſt a world of people; who, as he ſaith, from Cuſtom, and Tradition, run headlong after this Idol of mans invention.

But the con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trary is proved, The Adminiſtrators Right, a perſon qualified and ordeined; the manner, by ſprinkling or pouring out water Right, the form of words Right, and the ſubject Right: And therefore an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance that ſhal ſtand (mauger al the malice of men) as a pretious Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:168338:18"/> of Ieſus Chriſt, ſo long as the Sun &amp; Moon endures. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore inſtead of your appealing to men, ſince there hath been enough ſaid, If you and I had never written; let us appeal to God; and let all thoſe that own their childrens right in the Covenant ſay, <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>Page</hi> 25 he concludes again, that Infant Baptiſm is corrupt in the four Eſſentialls aforementioned,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw:</hi> Firſt then by his own words, tis not anihillated, but onely Corrupted, and that a perſon though corruptly Baptiz'd ought not to be Baptiz'd, that being already prooved. But,</p>
               <p>Secondly, He reckons without his hoſt, and therefore muſt come to a new accompt: They are not Eſſentialls, nor any of them, as laid down by him, but whimſies of his own brain; therefore.</p>
               <p>The next thing we are to follow him in is the buſineſs of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, with its diſtinctions and extent; from which he undertakes to prove, that Infants are not ſubjects of Baptiſm. Though we have hitherto built upon a good Foundation; yet if hee ſhakes down his main pillar, it will be time to forſake the houſe. But before wee can come to his Arguments, we muſt paſſe by many falſitis and prolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, and goe through many impertinencies, which muſt be born withall amongſt the Patrons of Error. The firſt thing he deals with is, A (pretended) falſe conſequence, which he ſaith, wee draw from ſcripture, to maintain Infant-Baptiſm: It runs thus, <q rend="margQuotes">The Covenant of Grace is made with beleevers, and their ſeed: Therefore the ſeale of the Covenant belongs to them. To diſprove which he tells us, 'tis againſt the Law of the new Teſtament.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The new Teſtament is Chriſts laſt will to his Church; in which hee ſhews forth more love then he did in his firſt Teſtament, which was made to the ſame Church; and the Covenant of Grace, in the ſpirituall part thereof, is the ſame in both: If therefore in the old Teſtament, which was his firſt Legacie, hee took Children into his kingdom, and yet now, his bowels ſhould be ſhut againſt them who are not then called into libertie, but a greater bondage then before. But grace in the Covenant being unchangeable, therefore Children ſtill remain within Chriſts kingdom, except our oppoſits can ſhew us how, when, and where they were out-law'd.</p>
               <p>Secondly, His inſiſting upon the Command, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. <hi>Go teach and Baptize,</hi> doth not at al croſs this conſequence, as hath been already proved; therefore no conſequence of ours is forc'd to oppoſe the new Teſtament.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, But ſuch without which his practice is not Goſpell,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:168338:18"/> becauſe it ſhuts up the tender bowels of our Lord Jeſus in a narrower compaſs then ever the Law did, and the fancies and burthens, Maſter <hi>Patient</hi> would put upon our ſhouldiers, in that which they call the Ordinance, would be heavier then ever the Loyns of the Law were; As to that Inſtance he brings of <hi>Peter</hi> in <hi>Page</hi> 26. to prove con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequencies againſt commands unlawfull, becauſe he would have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded Chriſt from ſuffering, in theſe words, <hi>Far be it from thee Lord:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Inſtead of handling the word like a Miniſter, he ſtretcheth the ſtrings of Scripture, till they crack: what kind of conſequence could this be, or from what place of Scripture, or againſt what command, was this a conſequence to ſay, <hi>Far be it from thee Lord?</hi> Surely the moſt any <hi>Engliſh</hi> Grammarian can make from thence is; That it was a diſſuaſive, but no conſequence. However, by this we may Judg how feeble this mans Judgment is, when he thinks God hath Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen him as one of thoſe, that ſhall confound the wiſe of the world, that doth not yet underſtand what a true, or right conſequence is.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="margQuotes">Maſter <hi>Patient</hi> afterwards tells us, that all ſuch conſequencies and books and arguments as are brought againſt commands (to prove Infant Baptiſm, which is cleerly implied) he may ſay of them, as Chriſt to <hi>Peter, Get the behind mee Satan, thou art an offence to me.</hi> Page 6.27.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Alas poor man, if the Phyſicks of truth offend his ſtomack, which ſhould cure him; 'tis a ſad ſigne hee is near paſt recovery. How ever, take this extract from his own Inſtance, that ſo far as any man ſhall diſſwade others from truth, and cauſe them to apoſtatize from the ways of Chriſt, hee Acts the Divels part, <hi>Ergo</hi> This I ſay not; Get thee behind me Satan but this I ſay, that book by him publiſht, in which he ſo bitterly reviles the good old wav of God: for the ends aforeſaid. The ſtate would doe well to have all ſuch books, though in Folio, put into an Index Expurgatorius, amongſt the whole Rabble of Erroneous and Hereticall peeces, that have been printed in theſe Licentions book-days: and ſo condemn them to the fire, as they have done others not fit to be ſuffered.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="margQuotes">In <hi>Page</hi> the 27 he pretends to come nearer the conſequence, and grounds thereof, but doth not cloſe till <hi>Page</hi>

               <p>Secondly, That the Covenant of Circumciſion was not of Grace, but works. Thirdly, That none but beleevers ever had, or ſhall have a right to the Covenant of Grace.</p>

               <p>To prove the firſt of theſe, hee brings ſeverall Scriptures: the main of which is, <hi>Jer</hi> 31.32.33 34. but to what purpoſe, it will afterwards appear: the words are theſe. <hi>Behold the days come, that I wil make a new Covenant with the houſe of Iſrael, &amp; the houſe of Judah; Not according to the Covenant I made with their Fathers, when I took them by the hand, to bring them out of the Land of Egypt;</hi> which my Covenant they brake, <hi>though I was to them a husband, ſaith the Lord.</hi> 
                  <q rend="margQuotes">where ſaith Maſter <hi>Patient,</hi> we find an old Covenant, and a new Covenant: the old broken, therefore of works; the new was not like the old, therefore of Grace <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>Thirdly, It was never intended by God, either in giving circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion to <hi>Abraham,</hi> or the Law to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that ever <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed ſhould enjoy <hi>Canaan,</hi> by the law as a Covenant of works, but only (as hath been laid down in the <hi>Analyſis</hi>) as mans part, of the covenant of grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But if that was not a covenant of works given to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when God took them by the hand, in order to bring them into <hi>Canaan,</hi> what then can be the meaning of that place, where the holy Ghoſt ſpeaks of, an old &amp; new Covenant? &amp; tells us the new Covenant which he will make after thoſe days, ſhall not be according to the old, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The clearing of this, with a Queſtian or two more, will take in all thoſe ſcriptures brought to this, and therefore I further anſwer.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The Covenant there mentioned is call'd <hi>new,</hi> as the <hi>Law</hi> of love, <hi>Iohn</hi> 13.34.1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.8. is call'd <hi>a new Commandment or Law:</hi> which yet is not new in it ſelf, but the ſame Command as was given to <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.18 And as the new heavens and new earth are call'd new <hi>Re.</hi> 21.1. And as the new Creature is call'd new, which is not the annihilating the old, and creating new, but the putting of the old heavens and old earth, into a new frame of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the old creature into a new ſtate of grace, ſo the new Covenant is the ſame that brought <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained remiſſion of ſins, and eternall life in Chriſt by faith with all the bleſſings of this life, but ſo call'd, new,</p>
               <p>Secondly, Becauſe thoſe typicall ceremonies and ordinances which were mans part of the Covenant of grace then, and related to his dutie in Gods worſhip, were by Chriſts coming aboliſht, and new ordinances under the Goſpell eſtabliſht in room thereof, for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing part of the Covenant of grace, from the beginning, hath ever been cloathed, with the preceptive Conditional part, to bind up man to his dutie, and walking cloſe with God in his Ordinances of worſhip. And therefore when Chriſt was held forth in the firſt promiſe, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly ſacrifices were inſtituted, a diſtinction made betwixt clean and unclean creatures, the Law of tithes and firſt fruits obſerved, blood forbidden: familie-duties required, all which a diligent reader of Scriptures, may eaſily obſerve, from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> before there was a publiſhing the Law from <hi>Sinay,</hi> and ſo to Chriſt, Track it from Chriſt again, to the worlds end, you have the firſt aboliſht, a ſecond inſtituted, and as then, ſo ſtill; to bind man to his dutie in walking
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:168338:21"/> with God, but not as in a diſtinct Covenant of works, but as the terms of grace, to which man is bound by the Covenant: and thus thoſe typicall ce emonies were as old clothes, and are called beggerly Rudiments or Rags, in which the promiſing part was clothed, and dreſt. The Apoſtle in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. calls the exhibition of Chriſt in fleſh, in offering up his blood by once dying, and ſuch manner of inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions as ſhould be written by him, to be the <hi>new Covenant verſe</hi> 15.16: and puts it in oppoſition to the Legall ſacrifices <hi>verſe</hi> 4. 5, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>verſe</hi> 19, 20. the ſecond is <hi>called the new and living way conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated,</hi> implying, that as there is now a way to heaven conſecrated by the blood of Chriſt, and therefore new; ſo there was a way to heaven before Chriſt came, conſecrated by the <hi>blood of Bulls and Goats, called</hi> old: by this then we ſee, in what reſpect the Covenant is called new and old, namely, as relating to a new or old <hi>Church-ſtate;</hi> the firſt given as typicall by <hi>Moſes</hi> to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as Chriſts kingdom; the ſecond as ſubſtantiall, by Chriſt to the ſame kingdom; but ſtill in the ſame Covenant of grace: for a Church ſtate is given in order to a ſoules enjoying, communion with God in his ordinances, which is impoſſible to be by a Covenant of works, ſince the fall; thus then, the bringing of <hi>Iſrael</hi> into a new Church-ſtate, under the Goſpell, is called a new Covenant, which God will make with the houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in thoſe daies: This gives us light, to anſwer alſo that other place <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.6, 7. by Maſter <hi>Patient</hi> quoted to prove two Covenants, <hi>becauſe Chriſt is called the Mediator of a better Covenant eſtabliſht upon better promiſes: for if the firſt Teſtament had been faultleſs, there would have been no place ſought for the ſecond; but finding fault with them, hee ſaith, behold the day is come, when I will make a new Covenant with the houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and</hi> verſe 13. <hi>In that he ſaith, a new Covenant, he hath made the firſt old: now that which waxeth old, is ready to vaniſh away.</hi> By which tearms old and new, firſt and ſecond, better and worſe, he would needs underſtand two Covenant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So ch. 7.19. <hi>the Law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did; by which we draw nigh to God:</hi> So that the Ordinances of drawing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Had thoſe typical Ordinances been a Covenant of Works gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven at Mount-<hi>Sinai</hi> to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> then it had not been put in the hand, of a Mediator. For where God gives a people a <hi>Mediator,</hi> is ſuppoſed, he intends them Grace thereby.

               <p>Here was the Covenant of Grace externally adminiſtred to all: but yet there was but a remnant ſaved, and the greateſt part of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were Covenant-breakers; and the like we have now, and is, and muſt be acknowledged by all our diſſenting friends of the dipt Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties, an external, and internal adminiſtration of the Covenant: For their confidence is not ſo high as to ſay, that all they dip are really within the Covenant, for we ſee many of them turn Apoſtates from every thing that is good, and prove carnal wretches; as did <hi>Simon Magus, Judas, Hymeneus, Philetus, Ananias,</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> who were all within the Covenant viſibly. If they ſay they baptize not upon the account of the Covenant at all, but upon the profeſſion of Faith; I anſwer, either they baptize as viſible believers, or real: if vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, then as viſibly within the Covenant; if as real, then really with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Covenant: ſo that ſtill the Covenant lies at bottom, and there is as much falling from Grace, and breach of the Covenant upon their own principles, as is pleaded for.

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If it be the condition of the covenant, then the covenant is not made without conditions.

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:168338:24"/> And here lyes much of Mr. <hi>Patients</hi> great miſtake, to take the tender of Grace for the covenant; and thus he falls into the Antinomian Doctrine: and therefore as faith and repentance is the condition, ſo the covenant is not concluded, betwixt God and the ſoul, till thoſe qualifications are wrought, therefore the veins of free-grace are full of riches, becauſe as God tenders, ſo he gives ſecretly the qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that lay hold upon the tender, ſo he did to our firſt Parents.</p>

But in this alſo there was but one covenant, which had two parts, Gods part and mans, which was their manner of covenanting with God to make an oath to walk in his ways: and when they had broken this oath; they had broken the covenant, ſecond their part of the covenant: ſee that place alſo, <hi>Neh.</hi> 10.29. <hi>They entred into a curſe to walk in the laws of God, that were given by Moſes the ſervant of the Lord;</hi> The Law given was the terms God bound them to in a way of Grace and Mercy, and their oath or curſe, declared their owning thereof; ſo that when the oath was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, the covenant was broken; therefore the deduction that Mr. <hi>Patient</hi> makes from theſe Texts, that there are two covenants, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound and rotten, and ſavours of too ignorant a ſpirit in the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace.

               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> The 28 page, tells us that the new covenant was never entailed upon any fleſhly line or generation as the covenant of circumciſion was, but was ſtill confirmed of God in Chriſt, and to ſuch onely in Chriſt as you finde in the promiſes to <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 12.3. <hi>In thee ſhall all nations of the earth be bleſſed</hi> In which there is no reſpect of perſons in their bleſſings to life, but all Nations in Chriſt, as well one as another are bleſt, and all out of Chriſt are accurſt.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> That by everlaſting we are to underſtand the <hi>ever</hi> of the Law onely, is no ſound maxim: for though it be ſo to be underſtood in the places quoted, becauſe it related to the Prieſthood, and Tabernacle worſhip; yet if that covenant in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.

               <p>From which it appear, that the word everlaſting is to be underſtood to a thouſand generations, <hi>i. e.</hi> to the worlds end; becauſe the giving <hi>Iſrael Canaan,</hi> was a type of heaven, and from <hi>Abrahams</hi> days to Chriſt was but forty two Generations.

                  <hi>P.</hi> page 47 he winds up thus: <hi>Abraham,</hi> as if God ſhould ſay, I will be thy God, and thy ſeeds God, to protect, defend, deliver and bleſs thee; with the bleſſings of <hi>Canaan,</hi> in the fruit of the womb in thy basket and ſtore, and with all outward bleſſings, upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that thou wilt be circumciſed, and keep the law as a covenant of works.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> A poor Argument, was it not? to prevail with <hi>Abraham</hi> when he might have replyed, Lord there are many that do poſſeſs a far greater portion in the world, yea thou haſt ſaid that my ſon <hi>Iſhmael</hi> ſhall have twelve Princes riſe from him, and that he ſhall be a great man in the earth, yet none of them are bound up to ſuch ſtrict obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations. And when thou gaveſt a covenant of works to <hi>Adam,</hi> he ſhould have had heaven, and eternal happineſs and glory. And ſhall I be content with an earthly portion upon ſuch hard terms?

                  <hi>P.</hi> Page 48. The laſt thing with which he concludes this firſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument (if ſuch it be) is this. <hi>Abraham</hi> had a covenant of Grace
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:168338:29"/> made with him, twenty four yeers before that covenant of works, and his happineſs with all his ſpiritual ſeed was in that abſolute cove<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Had M. <hi>Patients</hi> memory been good, he would not ſo have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted himſelf, For firſt, this covenant of works he hath made to begin from <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſo deſcended to <hi>Abraham.</hi> For he hath long before proved that the Law which was given from <hi>Sinai</hi> was in force before the days of <hi>Noah,</hi> how then is that like to hold with this, that the covenant of works was not given to <hi>Abraham?</hi> tis twenty four yeers after that of Grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2 If he make Circumciſion the covenant of works, that he means: then it implyes that <hi>Abraham</hi> had two covenants of works; one by deſcent, and the other made afterwards.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Where he tells us, the happineſs of his ſpiritual ſeed lies in the abſolute covenant; I anſwer, what ſpiritual ſeed had <hi>Abraham</hi> if it was not <hi>Iſaac?</hi> And yet <hi>Iſaac</hi> was the line in which the covenant of Circumciſion was to run, and not <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> Gen 17.21. So that look what happineſs the promiſe gave him of Gods being his God, was conveyed in that covenant: and either Mr <hi>Patient</hi> muſt ſay, it was no happineſs to him, to have God to be his God; or elſe if it was a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs: then he muſt acknowledge it in that covenant. Thus we ſee how ſadly he is be error'd: certainly had this Doctrine been brought in the Apoſtles days, he would have lookt upon it as another Goſpel, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> A ſecond Argument, though very improperly ſo called, to prove circumciſion a covenant of works, is, becauſe it was a national covenant in the fleſh.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The prudent Reader may eaſily obſerve what a poor ſhift this is to maintain Circumciſion a covenant of works; as if a covenant of Grace could not be national: and though what hath been ſaid to prove Circumciſion a covenant of pure Grace, be ſufficient; yet I ſhall briefly add: If the promiſe made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> was a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel promiſe, in wh ch were contained national bleſſings, <hi>in thy ſeed all the nations of the earth ſhall be bleſſed;</hi> If the Jews ſhall be re in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffed as they were cut off; If by the ſtone cut out of the moun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tains, that ſhall fill the world be to be underſtood the Church and kingdom of Chriſt; If the knowledge of the Lord ſhall cover the earth, as the waters cover the ſeas; If there ſhall be a new heaven, and a new earth, wherein ſhall dwell righteouſneſs; If the kingdom of God was taken from the Jews and given to another Nation:</p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:168338:30"/>
               <p>If the Church now coming out of the wilderneſs, holds parallel with the Church in the wilderneſs, under the Law; If the kingdoms of this world ſhall become the kingdoms of the Lord Chriſt, if that Commiſſion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. in order hereunto, be to teach all Nations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If that Nation and kingdom that will not ſerve Chriſt ſhall be cut off, <hi>Iſa</hi> 60.12. Then are the bleſſings of a covenant of Grace na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional bleſſings; and what God intended in <hi>Abrahams</hi> covenant was national: I need ſay no more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> In pag. 49, 50, 51, 52. he runs into a large field of diſcourſe, and over-runs the old Scriptures again (as it is uſual with him) to prove, that though the Jews had the covenant of Circumciſion given them by entail, yet as to matter of Juſtification they were as far off, as Pagans, and heathens: and what Juſtification <hi>Abraham</hi> had, was while he was uncircumciſed, and yet withal granting, That the Jews had the advantage of other Nations, by having thoſe Eminent ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Goſpel held out amongſt them. And notwithſtanding that covenant in the fleſh: yet they were all ſinners, and therefore there is but one way of Juſtification, which is by faith in his blood; therefore Circumciſion muſt needs be a covenant of works, for if it had been a covenant of Grace, it would have adminiſtred Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with it; This is the full ſenſe as neer as I can collect, out of ſuch ſtragling diſcourſes.</p>
               <p>Though the Scriptures he brings in theſe pages to prove what he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts were before omitted, yet I ſhall here take them in, as moſt fit in this place, becauſe the running over things ſo often, would otherwiſe make the Anſwer ſo bulkiſh, and therefore,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Though he ſaith, Juſtification by faith was not given by Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, <hi>i. e.</hi> by the act done, as neither is it now given by Baptiſm, yet Juſtification was given in that Covenant of Grace which Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion ſealed, and ſo the Elect did obtain it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. <hi>He recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the ſign of Circumciſion, a ſeal of the righteouſneſs of Faith, that he might be the Father of all that believe, though they be not Circumciſed.</hi> So that Circumciſion was the covenants ſeal, and not the ſeal of his faith, out of which the Gentile Nations were excluded, till that Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Church was caſt off, ſo that the Jews were neerer then Pagans and Heathens, notwithſtanding any thing he affirms, becauſe the one was under the call of the Goſpel and the tenders of Grace, when the other was a far off, <hi>Aliens and ſtrangers,</hi> Eph. 2.11, 12, 13. But when the Goſpel came amongſt them alſo, <hi>then they were made nigh by the blood
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:168338:30"/> of Chriſt.</hi> The Heathens in New-<hi>England,</hi> will any ſober under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding Chriſtian ſay, they are as neer to a ſtate of Juſtification as thoſe that are born and bred up, and dwell under the ſound of the Goſpel? yea Mr. <hi>P.</hi> himſelf doth contradict what he in this affirms, in acknowledging that the Jews were priviledged before o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations, in having ſuch precious tenders of the Goſpel, <hi>p.</hi> 49. ſo that we ſee he doth not ſtick faſt to his own judgement in any thing. But wherein theſe precious priviledges ſhould lye, or how the G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. There is not any one place, or Text or ſyllable in the 2, 3. or 4 to <hi>Rom.</hi> or in 12, 15, 17, 18, 22. of <hi>Gen.</hi> or 3, 4, 5. <hi>Gal.</hi> that ſaith, Juſtification by faith was not given in the covenant of Circumciſion, or that Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by faith is oppoſed to Circumciſion, or that becauſe <hi>Abraham</hi> was Juſtified, before circumciſed; therefore Circumciſion is a covenant of Works. But this the Texts ſay, that juſtification is to be had in the covenant of Circumciſion, which were it a covenant of works, would not there be found, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.1, 2, 3, 30. But</p>
               <p n="3">3. And becauſe he tells us in pag. 55.

               <p>To cleer this place therefore from this cloud of error caſt upon it, I ſhall ſtay ſome time, to ſearch into it. The words are theſe; <hi>What ſhall we ſay then, that</hi> Abraham <hi>our Father as appertaining to the fleſh hath found? For if</hi> Abraham <hi>was juſtified by works, He hath where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to glory, but not before God; but</hi> Abraham <hi>believed God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And how was it then reckoned? when he was in Circumciſion, or in uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion? not in Circumciſion,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> By comparing this with the preceding chapter, as alſo with <hi>ch.</hi> 5, 6, 7, 8. we finde the Roman Church that had imbraced the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nances of the Goſpel, were then falling back into the works of the Law, and thoſe legal Ordinances, in them to gain juſtification. And
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:168338:31"/> therefore they would be liſtening after thoſe falſe Teachers that preacht up Circumciſion after the manner of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which was the prevailing error in that Church, and is at this day, it being ſo fallen that they maintain good works, do juſtifie. Now the Apoſtle to bring them off from this error, bids them look upon <hi>Abraham,</hi> whom they acknowledged to be the father of the faithful; and ſee how the caſe ſtood with him, how he was juſtifyed; ſecretly implying that if he that was the Father of all believers was not juſtifyed by works, then it would be unreaſonable in his children to think that they were; and therefore it was their duty to follow him: by which we ſee <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> is held forth as a publick perſon in the Goſpel, to which Goſpel-Churches are to have recourſe, to rectifie errors in doctrines of Faith; and if upon ſearch they found that <hi>Abraham</hi> was juſtifyed in urcir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, then they ſhould not think that Circumciſion was of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſity to juſtification; and therefore tells them it was their miſtake, the Law was never intended by God to juſtifie any, but <hi>ch.</hi> 3.9. <hi>both Jew and Gentile are all under ſin,</hi> and ver. 20. <hi>therefore by the deeds of the Law no fleſh can be juſtifyed, for all have ſinned, and are therefore juſtifyed freely by his Grace without the deeds of the Law,</hi> ver. 28. upon which the Romans make this Objection, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.1. What benefit or advantage then hath <hi>Abraham</hi> found, to whom the covenant was made? The meaning is becauſe <hi>Abraham</hi> had not his juſtification by circumciſion; therefore they could not ſee any Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-benefit that came by that Ordinance at all; ſo much is implyed in the words: the like alſo ch. 3. <hi>what profit then is there of Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion?</hi> and it is the ſame objection in effect that M. <hi>P.</hi> makes, onely a little changed, For thus his runs: If <hi>Abraham</hi> was not juſtified in the covenant of Circumciſion, then is Circumciſion a covenant of works: both which the Apoſtle anſwers, that though <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed were not juſtifyed by the Law, as a law or covenant of works; yet there was a conſiderable advantage the Jews had by circumciſion, <hi>and chiefly, becauſe unto them were c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Not to that ſeed onely which is of the Law And then the Apoſtle concludes, <hi>ver.</hi> 23. <hi>that it was not written for Abrahams ſake alone that righteouſneſs was imputed to him, but for us alſo,</hi> i. e. <hi>Rom.</hi> and all other Gentiles, if they believe, to whom <hi>Abraham</hi> is as well a Father, as to the Jews.</p>
               <p>So that this triumphant place gives not the leaſt continuance to his opinion; either that Circumciſion was a covenant of works, or that it ſtands in direct oppoſition to ſaith, or that God gave a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to ſeal a covenant of Grace, as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequentially affirms, p. 53. Therefore ſuch an interpretation as he hath given of this place is moſt unſound.</p>

The like plain anſwer alſo is and may he given to that other place, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.3. which Church alſo were back ſliding into the ſame error, and therefore he calls them fools, and tells them they were bewitched <hi>ch.</hi> 5.1. And if they would be ſeeking Juſtification by works, they ſhould find they were miſtaken. <hi>For as many as ſought to be juſtifyed by the works of the Law, were under the curſe. And that no man by the works of the Law was ever juſtifyed, is evident, becauſe the juſt ſhall live by Faith,</hi> ver. 10, 11. And therefore he ſends them alſo to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> covenant, <hi>For to Abraham and his ſeed were the promiſes made.</hi> And <hi>ver.</hi> 18. he ſhews them the ill-conſequence that would follow, if they thought to be juſtifyed by works, <hi>For then the inheritance muſt

The anſwer is, <hi>it was added becauſe of tranſgreſſion,</hi> that is, to make ſin look like ſin; and thereby to ingage Gods people then, to walk cloſe in the duties thereof, and in ver. 21. The Apoſtle directly confutes Mr. <hi>Patients</hi> Doctrine. <hi>Is the Law then againſt the Promiſes, or in oppoſition to the Promiſes? God forbid.</hi> By all which it appears that the Law was no covenant of Works, nor is Circumciſion or any part of the Law op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to Faith, as he would make us beheve; but this was the great miſtake of many in Primitive Churches by falſe teachers means. And ſo of all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as it is alſo of Mr <hi>P.</hi> that the Law was given to the Church of the Jews as a covenant of works, which God never inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to any ſuch end or purpoſe.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> The next thing we come to is the ſeveral Arguments he brings in <hi>p. 53.</hi> to prove Circumciſion onely a ſeal to <hi>Abraham,</hi> anſwered.</head>
               <p n="1">I. FIrſt, becauſe the righteouſneſs of Faith which it ſealed, <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> had it, before the ſeal was given, but his poſterity could not be ſaid to believe at eight days old: Therefore it was a ſeal to him, and not to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The ſeal was not annext to <hi>Abrahams</hi> Faith, as <hi>Abrahams,</hi> but to Gods covenant made with <hi>Abraham;</hi> therefore it is called the ſeal of the righteouſneſs of Faith. So that what it ſealed to <hi>Abraham</hi> was, as he was <hi>an heir of the ſame Promiſes with Iſaac and Jacob,</hi> Heb. 11.9. therefore what it ſealed to him as an heir, it ſealed to <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and ſo to <hi>all believers as co-heirs of the ſame inheritance,</hi> Heb. 6.17.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If it was a ſeal of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Faith onely, then it muſt be either as it was a weak faith, or ſtrong faith.</p>
               <p n="1">1 It could not be the firſt, becauſe <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith is by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaid not to be weak, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.19, 20.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:168338:32"/>2. If it had been given as a badge of honor to <hi>Abrahams</hi> Faith (as I have ſeen it affirmed in a piece or <hi>C. B.</hi>) as a ſtrong faith: then it ſhould have been given to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> who had as ſtrong faiths as <hi>Abraham;</hi> and leſs Goſpel-light then <hi>Abraham</hi> had to work it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There was no neceſſity to have <hi>Abrahams</hi> juſtification ſealed, more then <hi>Adams, Seths, Noahs,</hi> or any of his predeceſſors, eſpecially if it be conſidered what M. <hi>P.</hi> himſelf grants, that he was juſtifyed twenty four years before this ſeal was given, therefore</p>
               <p n="4">4. Had it not been a ſeal to <hi>Iſaac,</hi> as well as to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ſo not onely a ſeal of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, it might have been given upon the birth of <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> need not have ſtaid for a ſon of promiſe, for it would have ſealed as much then to <hi>Abraham,</hi> as it did after, if it was not the covenant-ſeal.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Had it not been a ſeal to <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and ſo a part of the covenant, then <hi>Iſaacs</hi> not being circumciſed had been no breach of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; directly againſt that place, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.10. For a ſeal the Apoſtle calls it, and a ſign God calls it. So that had it onely been a ſeal of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Faith, the covenant had not come ſealed to <hi>Iſaac;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſeal reacht onely the Faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and when he dyed, the ſeal was broken off. Therefore</p>
               <p n="6">6. It is a cleer truth, that as the bleſſings of the covenant were made to <hi>Abraham</hi> by Promiſe, and to his ſeed, ſo Gods main drift being to make <hi>thoſe covenant-bleſſings ſure to all the heirs of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,</hi> Heb. 6.17: he therefore deals as a man that would be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Firſt he promiſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, ſecondly, he ſwears to confirm that Promiſe, Thirdly, he ſeals what he hath promiſed. So the ſeal becomes the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-ſeal, as the oath is the Covenants oath: and what God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> he promiſed to his ſeed; and what he confirmed by oath to <hi>Abraham</hi> he confirmed to his ſeed; and what God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſealed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> he ſealed alſo to his ſeed. All which was <hi>to ſhew the immutability of his Counſel to the heirs of Promiſe,</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſuch as were heirs under the Law, but to the <hi>worlds end,</hi> as the Apoſtle tells us before, in the place quoted.</p>
               <p n="2">II. His next reaſon or Argument why it ſealed onely to <hi>Abraham</hi> is, becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>he received it, that he might be the Father of all that believe.</hi> Which could not be ſaid of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> becauſe he was but a child.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Though <hi>Abraham</hi> was made the Father of the faithful, by having that ſeal given him; yet he could not have been ſuch a father without ſuch a ſon, becauſe they are relatives, not onely in the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:168338:33"/> relation, but in the promiſe, for though <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was born thirteen yeers before <hi>Iſaac</hi> was promiſed; yet had God given him circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion then, <hi>Abraham</hi> had not been the Father of the faithful, becauſe <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was not a faithful child. So that, that which was required to make <hi>Abraham</hi> a father of a faithful ſon, was required in <hi>Iſaac</hi> to make him ſuch a ſon of a faithful Father: Therefore that ſeal that was given to <hi>Abraham</hi> as a father, was given to <hi>Iſaac</hi> as a ſon.</p>
               <p n="3">III. His third Argument to prove it a ſeal onely to <hi>Abraham</hi> is Here is the ſpirit of God affirming the ſealing uſe of Circumciſion to <hi>Abraham</hi> onely, upon a reaſon ſpecial to him; therefore where the Scripture hath not a mouth to ſpeak, we muſt not have an ear to hear.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The ſpirit of God ſpeaks no ſuch thing, but the ſpirit of M. <hi>P.</hi> for where is it ſaid, <hi>it was a ſeal to him onely?</hi> no ſuch Text is to be ſound in all the Scriptures, for as is before ſaid, what it ſealed to him as a father, it ſealed to <hi>Iſaac</hi> as a ſon of that Father, for the covenant related to poſterity. I may therefore ſay of him as the Prophet ſaid of the falſe Prophets, who ſaid the Lord ſaith it, as here M <hi>P.</hi> doth, when indeed the Lord hath not ſpoken: therefore the Scripture hath a mouth to ſpeak, if he had an underſtanding heart to know when and what it ſpeaks: let ſuch therefore who have ears to hear, hear what the ſpirit ſpeaks to the Churches.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. <hi>P.</hi> A fourth ground or reaſon he gives that Circumciſion ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed onely to <hi>Abraham,</hi> is drawn from <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.13. <hi>The promiſe that he ſhould be the heir of the world was not to him and his ſeed through the Law,</hi> i. e. ſaith M. <hi>P.</hi> through the covenant of Circumciſion, <hi>But through the righteouſneſs of Faith. For if they that be of the Law be heirs, then Faith is made void.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. He here again ſuppoſes that which is denyed, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary proved, <hi>i. e.</hi> That Circumciſion was not a covenant of works.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When it is ſaid <hi>the promiſe of his being the heir of the world was not made to Abraham through the Law,</hi> The Apoſtle means, that it was not to be confined and ſhut up to the generations of the Law onely, and ſo it was not to his ſeed through the Law onely, but through the righteouſneſs of Faith; that is, his Patrimony came up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch high tearms as would <hi>reach to a thouſand generations,</hi> Pſal. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>05. even to the Gentiles under the Goſpel to the worlds end: and that this is his meaning is clear, by the following words, <hi>For if they which are of the Law be heirs</hi> (i. e. They and they onely, but heirs they were, <hi>Faith is made void.</hi> That is, the faith which <hi>Abraham</hi> had, by which he did believe the multiplying of his ſeed in all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:168338:33"/> upon the grounds of the Promiſe, that faith is quite fruſtrated, becauſe it went no further then the generations of the Law; <hi>And therefore it is of faith that it might be by Grace, to the end the promiſe might be ſure to all the ſeed,</hi> and then he fully explains what he ſaid before, <hi>Not ſure to that ſeed onely, which were of the Law,</hi> where the word <hi>onely</hi> doth ſuppoſe it was ſure to the legal ſeed, therefore it cannot be meant of a covenant of works, for ſo the promiſe was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſure to any from the Creation to this day, or ever ſhall be.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If the place were to be underſtood in his ſenſe, namely of a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of works, Then it confutes in direct terms w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>at he hath ſo much pleaded for in his book. As that <hi>Canaan</hi> ſhould be given by a covenant of works. For the promiſe that he ſhould be the heir of the world, (in which that land was included) was not to him and his ſeed through the Law, <hi>i e.</hi> ſaith Mr <hi>P</hi> not by the covenant of Circumciſion, but through the righteouſneſs of faith. And if the Apoſtle ſaith, not by that covenant, then why doth Mr <hi>P.</hi> ſo often affirm elſewhere it was?</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee, there is nothing in all he hath ſaid, that proves Ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion either a covenant of works or ſeal to <hi>Abraham</hi> onely, but enough to prove it a ſeal to all the heirs of promiſe, even whilſt they are infants: All ye therefore that belong to the covenant of Grace, fear not to give your infant-ſeed that Ordinance which now is the ſeal of the covenant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> The laſt Scripture he here brings to prove Circumciſion a cove<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nant of works is <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. latter end, where the Apoſtle compa es the two covenants to <hi>Sarah</hi> and <hi>Hagar,</hi> the covenant of Circumciſion is held forth to be the bondwoman, <hi>ch.</hi> 5.1.2, 3. <hi>ch</hi> 6.13. wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ch place doth prove, the covenant made in the fleſhly line of <hi>Abraham</hi> is a covenant of Works. And that which the Goſpel is ſet in oppoſition to, For the covenant of Grace is, <hi>I will put my Law in their hearts</hi> but the covenant of Circumciſion is not in the heart, but in the fleſh.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The diligent Reader may eaſily obſerve the palpable contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions that are here to be found. <hi>Hagar</hi> types out the covenant of works. <hi>Sarah</hi> types out the covenant of grace, and the fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſhly cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Circumciſion (as he calls it) which is typed out by <hi>Hagar,</hi> is made in the fleſhly line of <hi>Abraham</hi> which muſt be <hi>Iſhmael.</hi> And then he contradicts what he hath been all this while maintaining, <hi>i e.</hi> that the fleſhly line is <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> in which the covenant of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion was to run: and ſo alſo he oppoſeth the Apoſtle <hi>Gal.</hi> 4 23
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:168338:34"/> 
                  <hi>But he that was born of the bondwoman, was born after the fleſh: but he of the free-woman was by Promiſe;</hi> ſo that what <hi>Paul</hi> calls the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by promiſe, he calls the children of the fleſh. Thus men leaving truth making wiſe, God leaves them to publiſh their own folly.</p>
               <p>That place <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.2, 3. is already anſwered, they were ſuch that were falling back from Grace to be juſtified by works through their groſs miſtake, thinking as Mr <hi>P.</hi> doth, that the Law had been given for a covenant of works.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Though God hath promiſed to write the new covenant in the heart, yet the ſeals of that covenant are written in the fleſh: ſo it was then. For God writ the new covenant in the heart, under the Law, and yet circumciſion was no covenant of works. But a figure of what God did within, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.28, 29. by which places we may ſee Circumciſion had the ſame promiſes attending it then to believers and their ſeed, as baptiſm hath now. And it may with as much evidence of truth, be ſaid, that baptiſm is a covenant of Works, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is adminiſtred upon the fleſh; as Circumciſion was then. Therefore all his Arguments and Scriptures he hath brought hitherto to prove Circumciſion a covenant of works, have been ill drawn, and worſe applyed.</p>

               <p n="3">III. <hi>P:</hi> pag. 58. WE are now come to his third Argument, and that is, becauſe there is no promiſe of eternal life in it, but only a temporal bleſſing in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and proviſion, and the like, to prove this he quotes <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.6: <hi>Jer.</hi> 11.2, 3. <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.12, 13, &amp; 30, 13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. That Circumciſion, had no promiſe of eternal life attending it is falſe, for eternal life was promiſed in Gods telling <hi>Abraham,</hi> he would be his God; it is ſuch a <hi>blank,</hi> that a believer may write what happineſs he will in it: God could not ſay more, nor a believer deſire more.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It had the promiſe of the heart-Circumciſion in order to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare a ſoul for heaven, as the places above cited prove. Therefore it had the promiſe alſo of eternal life.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:168338:34"/>3. If it had not had the promiſe of eternal happineſs, but onely an earthly <hi>Canaan,</hi> and protection therein, then in vain doth S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, <hi>God was not aſhamed to be called Abrahams God,</hi> Heb. 11.16. And <hi>in vain alſo did he with Iſaac and Jacob walk as Pilgrims in that land, expecting a better Country,</hi> i. e. <hi>a heavenly,</hi> Heb. 11.8, 14, 16.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As to thoſe Texts he mentions, there is not one of them proves that God only promiſed <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed proſperity in <hi>Canaan,</hi> though that alſo was included, upon their obedience to Gods covenant, which was of Grace, not works, as hath been before largely proved We ſee therefore how well he hath diſtinguiſht the Covenants.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> IV. His next Argument to prove Circumciſion a covenant of works is, becauſ a man by laying out a little mony might have bought a heathen into this covenant, and have intereſſed him into all the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The covenant had <hi>two parts,</hi> one <hi>external,</hi> relating to mans du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in forms of worſhip; The other <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> relating to communion with God in thoſe forms, as hath been often mentioned; into the firſt of theſe, all the perſons born in <hi>Abrahams</hi> houſe, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ought with mony were to be admitted, and the reaſon is, becauſe all <hi>Abrahams</hi> family ſo qualifyed were <hi>the viſible Church,</hi> and ſuch a taking into his family was a taking into the Church: which alſo w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s a type of the purchaſe that Chriſt ſhould pay by his blood. For the Gentiles, we e to be brought into Church-communion, of which that was the firſt fruits, both to them and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>heir ſeed; for doing whereof, Gods command did bear him out. And this was to be a ſtanding rule to <hi>Iſrael</hi> when they came to be a king<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dom, becauſe the foundation of the kingdom was laid in <hi>Abrahams</hi> family, Therefore,</p>
               <p n="2">2. When he ſaith, that all ſo bought, were purchac'd into all the priviledges of the covenant, it is a groſs untruth: for juſtification, and ſalvation were the choice priviledges of that covenant wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>V. <hi>P.</hi> His next Argument is, becauſe men out of this covenant might be ſaved, and ſuch as were in it might be damned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Here is ſtill the ſame diſtinction to be noted as before, for thoſe that went to hell were never intereſſed in the ſpiritual part of the covenant, but onely into the external forms of worſhip; the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

[The children of the kingdom ſhall be caſt out.] I would a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn this Argument to M: <hi>P.</hi> How many dipt Apoſtates have fallen quite away from all grace and goodneſs of late yeers, both from them and us? Surely it cannot be denyed, but they were viſibly once in the covenant; therefore all thoſe Scriptures and examples by him brought in, pag. 62, 63, 64. are by this diſtinction anſwered, and the falſe varniſh by him put upon them is hereby waſht off, that ſo they may be ſeen in their glory and ſplendor.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It alſo appears that it was the ſame covenant of Grace that juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed <hi>Lot, Job,</hi> and all <hi>Jobs</hi> friends that were godly, though dwelling in another Country, that juſtifyed <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed: for though they had not the ſeal of the covenant, becauſe <hi>Abraham</hi> was the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon pitcht upon, to whom it ſhould be firſt adminiſtred; yet they were worſhippers of God in a ſolemn way of ſacrificing: the like we may charitably think now, that many in the world who have not the ſame means of Goſpel-Ordinances, may yet have ſincere hearts to God, and be as a ſcattered ſeed of ſome gracious predeceſſors; and yet not be within the viſible pale of the covenant.</p>
               <p>This alſo duely conſidered, is a full anſwer to the reſt of thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, of <hi>Davids</hi> ſons, and <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſons, with the whole lump of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> of all which many were damned, becauſe onely in the viſible part of the covenant. We may therefore ſee hitherto what feeble Arguments Mr. <hi>Patient</hi> brings to prove Circumciſion a covenant of works.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. <hi>P.</hi> His ſixth Argument for the ends aboveſaid is, becauſe this covenant of Circumciſion may be broken, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.14.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Still the former diſtinction kept makes the anſwer eaſie and plain; for ſuch who broke the covenant, broke but the external part thereof; the other part could not be broken, and in this ſenſe alſo the covenant in Goſpel days is broken, and as God unchurcht <hi>Iſrael</hi> for breach of covenant, ſo he doth ſtill, when a Church or people do apoſtatize from his Ordinances: The Apoſtle tells us ſo, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.6 <hi>Whoſe houſe are we if we hold faſt the confidence and rejoycing of the hope firm to the end,</hi> his meaning is, we are his houſe if we keep to
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:168338:35"/> the <hi>Ordinances of worſhip:</hi> implying, That if a people once caſt off the Ordinances, they have broken the covenant, and ſtand related to Chriſt no longer as his houſe. I am ſure that the extent of this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication will reach Mr <hi>Patient,</hi> who hath broken the covenant of God, by caſting out of his ſeed. And upon this very hinge it was, That all thoſe examples of Gods judgements upon <hi>Iſrael</hi> are given, when they revolted from God, and brake this covenant, then God plagues them and cuts them off; and when they renewed their cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, faſted, humbled their ſouls and repented, God ſhewed Mercy; all which agrees to that remarkable place, which proves the covenant of Grace conditional, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.19. <hi>For I know A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham will command his children and his houſhould after him, and they ſhall keep the Way of the Lord, to do Juſtice and judgement. That the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he hath ſpoken of him;</hi> cleerly implying, that if <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed did not walk cloſe in their duties, they ſhould fall ſhort of their expectations, as we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards finde <hi>Iſrael</hi> did.</p>
               <p>Therefore whereas M. <hi>P.</hi> ſaith it is impoſſible the covenant of Grace ſhould be broken, it is falſe. For the external part may be broken, which is part of the covenant: but the inward part of it can never be broken.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> Pag. 67. He comes to anſwer this diſtinction of the covenant as an Objection, but ſo poorly, that it ſeems he would gladly favour his own opinion; perſons ſaith he, may profeſs outwardly, to be in Chriſt, and ſo in the covenant of Grace by profeſſion: but becauſe it was but a profeſſion onely, and not in truth; therefore they profeſs to be in that wherein they never were.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> We are now ſpeaking of perſons being in the covenant as the Scripture holds them forth, to be within it; And as men may in the judgement of Charity believe perſons to be in it, in or<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der to Communion of Saints in the world. If therefore the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures tell us there is a twofold being in it, then perſons are in the covenant that are within the viſible part of, as hath been ſufficiently proved, and as his own practice doth acknowledge: ſo that in his anſwer to the Objection, he rather works like a ferry<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>man, then a preacher; he ſeems to look towards an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, but rows the other way: therefore whereas he ſaith, we have an infallible rule to judge <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed to be within the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Circumciſion, becauſe God ſaith it, and the Objection before is groundleſs.</p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:168338:36"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It hath bean already cleared, that Circumciſion was part of the covenant of Grace; and therefore by this he confeſſeth that perſons are viſible within it, becauſe the infallible rule of the word of God ſaith it; and ſo was the ſeed he ſpeaks of infallible (as he calls it) within the Covenant: The like now, all that by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, are admitted into Goſpel-Churches. We have the ſame rule to judge by. That they are as really within the covenant as the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> was then; By which we may ſee the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſtands in force, notwithſtanding thoſe puffs of wind, he hath given at it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Neither doth his bringing in that great Catalogue of <hi>Iſraels</hi> ſins at all help him; For though it is not denyed but the moſt part of them were wicked and prophane, yet as a ſeparated people God had choſen out, from the reſt of the world, to be a Church, to whom he committed his <hi>Oracles,</hi> in that ſenſe they were a people in cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and ſo ſtood till they were divorc't, and caſt off from being a people. For which ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. at large. And the reaſon why they were ſo wicked and profane, may be gathered from that place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.19. becauſe they kept not up family du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, grew carnal and looſe in their Judgements; and therefore looſeneſs in practice and converſation followed; a needful Item to all Gods people in theſe days.</p>
               <p>The like anſwer is to be given to <hi>Joh.</hi> 8 40, 44. by all which then it appears, that not one Argument he hath hitherto brought, proves Circumciſion to be a covenant of works: we are now arrived at his laſt Argument, and that drawn from the many inconveniencies that will follow, if it be maintained a covenant of Grace: therefore ſo to underſtand Scriptures, as to croſs any fundamentals, cannot be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the mind of God.</p>

               </list>
               <p>Theſe and all theſe, outward, and inward: ſo that, by vertue of the extent of the covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> perſons are born into thoſe outward priviledges, though not into the ſpiritual part thereof: and thus were <hi>Iſrael</hi> adopted, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.4. For it is one of the firſt priviledges that St. <hi>Paul</hi> reckons <hi>Iſrael</hi> had, <hi>to whom pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Adoption and the glory,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>By which we ſee that the Adoption appertained to all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that is, God made choice of them, to make them his peculiar ſons and people, by taking them into the viſible pale of the covenant of grace,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:168338:37"/> when all the Nations of the earth beſides were paſt by. So that no people, or Nation in the world could ſay God was their father, but the Jews; which is the benefit of Adoption in either reſpect. But inward Adoption runs more ſpiritually, <hi>therefore called the ſpirit of Adoption,</hi> Rom. 8.</p>
               <p>Thus alſo, all <hi>Iſrael</hi> were the <hi>ſons of God,</hi> for which the Scripture is ſo cleer. That ſuch who deny it do but diſcover much ignorance. See therefore theſe Texts, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.1. <hi>ch.</hi> 11.1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.41. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.21. And thus they are called the firſt-born, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.22, 23.

               <p n="2">2. And thus all thoſe Scriptures, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.2. <hi>by nature children of wrath,</hi> Rom. 3.9. <hi>none righteous, no not one,</hi> are anſwered. This was alſo the equal condition of <hi>Paul, David,</hi> and the reſt born and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in ſin; and yet, as <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, they were intereſſed in the covenant then, as believers and their ſeed are now. We may then ſee how his heap of chaff caſt upon the truth, begins already to be blown away:</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>P.</hi> The ſecond fundamental which he proclaims to the world, that our practice overturns is, ſtability in a covenant of eternal life; for if all Iſrael were born in the covenant of Grace then all ſhould
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:168338:37"/> be ſaved, but there were but a remnant of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſaved, all the reſt damned. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 10.22, 23. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.22. And if ſo born, they muſt needs fall away from Grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> As ſtability in Grace is a glorious truth, ſo neither doth this touch it. For it onely makes the outward part of the covenant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable. That is a falling away from their viſible being in the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, for as hath been ſaid, a man may be in the covenant, yet not in the Grace of the covenant. Thus <hi>Iſrael</hi> and all thoſe Goſpel hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites mentioned, fell away, but the election ſtill remained: ſo the branches that were in Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. <hi>that bare not fruit, were cut off and withered:</hi> and thus all thoſe Texts that ſpeak of a falling away are to be underſtood. The like now; though many Apoſtates fall from the ways of God, yet the covenant remains ſtable, and the ſame for ever.</p>
               <p n="3">III. <hi>P.</hi> The third foundation he pretends to be ſhaken, is the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of converſion, and regeneration which is a Doctrine eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confirmed by Chriſt in the Goſpel, for which he brings ſeveral Texts of Scripture: but to hold a covenant of life to run upon the carnal ſeed of believers oppoſeth this: for then when Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a man be born again, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o heaven then by believing, and 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. <hi>He that hath not the Son hath not life.</hi> This error replyes, there be thouſands intereſſed in life, without having Chriſt, by carnal generation. Thus far he, with much more of the like ſtuffe, with which he fills three pages together.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Neither doth it at all intrench upon this Doctrine, as falſly ſuggeſted: therefore to cleer this we are to conſider, firſt the ground of this miſtake of his from whence it riſeth, as any man may eaſily ſee; namely, that the Doctrine of Converſion, Repentance, and Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, is to be preacht onely to ſuch as are without the Church, and Kingdom of Chriſt: for his argument runs as taking it for granted, that ſuch as are the ſubjects of the kingdom, are ſuch in reality, when as by the former diſtinctions, it is moſt apparent, that ſome are ſuch viſibly onely, and ſome really.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Therefore conſider, the Doctrines mentioned are part of that Goſpel, which is the kingdoms Goſpel, as Chriſt calls it, and hath been ever preacht to the ſubjects of the kingdom, ſo it was to <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old; and though believers and their ſeed were taken into the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:168338:38"/> (already proved to be of grace) yet this Doctrine of the new birth was preacht to them; which is abundantly cleer from Chriſts words to <hi>Nicodemus, Joh.</hi> 3. a place by himſelf quoted: <hi>Art thou a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor in Iſrael, and knoweſt not what the doctrine of the new birth means?</hi> implying, That he ſhewed himſelf very ignorant, when he knew not that which was preacht amongſt <hi>Iſrael:</hi> adding this alſo, That the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of Circumciſion ſo frequently uſed, was but a Type of the Circumciſion upon the heart, yea the whole tenor of the old-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment runs in ſuch terms that cleerly ſhew their bleſſedneſs lies in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting and turning to God in pardon of ſin, in ſetting their delight in the Laws of the Lord, truſting in God, and ſetting their hope in God, the book of Pſalms is full of it. So alſo in thoſe primitive Churches planted by the Apoſtles themſelves, who in admiſſion of members, had a better inſight to the truth of grace upon the heart, then any ſince, and yet this Doctrine they preacht to the Church, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.29. <hi>ch</hi> 6.11.8.10. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.19. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.23. therefore ſuch as think the Doctrines of Repentance, New-birth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhould be preacht to the world onely, may hence ſee their miſtakes, amongſt which number Mr <hi>P.</hi> is one, I ſhall ſtill draw down the parallel to his practice, which I judge to be a good way to convin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Therefore</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let us glean up his Scriptures, The reproof that <hi>John</hi> gave the Phariſees, was not for pleading a title to <hi>Abrahams</hi> covenant as his ſeed, for it is evident he bapt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>zed upon that accompt: for had not the Phariſees claimed the Ordinances as <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, becauſe the reſt did ſo, the reproof given them had been little better then non-ſenſe, but he checks them for their wickedneſs, in not walking as became <hi>Abrahams</hi> children. So alſo <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.32. The like alſo <hi>Luke</hi> 16. a place M. <hi>P.</hi> much delights to name, thinking it makes for his opinion becauſe <hi>Dives</hi> in hell owned <hi>Abraham</hi> as a Father, and <hi>Abraham</hi> owned him as a ſon, but yet for all that ſaith Mr. <hi>Patient,</hi> he was damned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> There is none denyes, but <hi>Abraham</hi> had more children damned then ſaved, yet nevertheleſs ſuch as were ſaved, were <hi>Abrahams</hi> chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and ſaved by <hi>Abrahams</hi> covenant. And it is impoſſible that M. <hi>P.</hi> himſelf ſhould ever be ſaved out of that covenant, though at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:168338:38"/> he ſo much ſlights it: The reproof therefore that was given to <hi>Dives,</hi> was not becauſe he called <hi>Abraham</hi> Father, as one of his ſons, but becauſe he lived as an Epicure and a glutton, as the whole para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble makes evident. And methinks <hi>Abrahams</hi> Charity ſhould be a ſufficient reproof to Mr. <hi>P.</hi> for his want thereof: whereas therefore he tels us we have found out a newer way to heaven, then by the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of regeneration, it is but a taunt, wherein he diſcovers by what ſpirit he writes and ſpeaks; Let therefore ſuch ingenious ſpirits to whom he makes his appeal, judge righteous judgement.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is ſtill to argue <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con.</hi> For if Faith be the hand and condition of the covenant, then it is on the creatures ſide, that it is ſo, and not on Gods. And the covenant is not made with any creature till they have a hand to receive it. And though it be given by free-grace, yet when it is given, it is the creatures hand; as the hand and eye of my body, it is free-grace that gives them, but when they are given, they are my hands and my eys. And thus the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle argues, it is of faith that it may be by grace; and hereby grace doth abound, that God ſhould give the Goſpel, and Covenant upon conditions; and when theſe conditions are wrought by his Grace, yet he ſhould look upon them, as ours; yea Mr <hi>Patient</hi> hath before ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, That faith is the condition of the covenant, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whereas he here tells us God infuſeth faith, and binds himſelf o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to the ſoul without conditions, it is a meer contradiction; becauſe that faith ſo infuſed, is that condition which takes hold on the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: and by this new covenant, were <hi>Abraham, Iſaac, Jacob, Joſeph, David, Solomon, Nathan,</hi> and all the people of God under the old-Teſtament, juſtifyed and ſaved; into the viſible part of which cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, all their ſeed was taken, yea the whole Nation of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And that they ſhall be ſo taken in again, ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. at large compared with <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.1. therefore for him to call it a dream, is not onely a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of his ſhallowneſs, but alſo an affront put upon thoſe holy worthies before mentioned, by which he doth manifeſt it to the world, affirming that the Covenant of Grace hath no conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that he is a high Antinomian, as well as an Anabaptiſt.</p>
               <p>V. <hi>P.</hi> pag. 80. His next Fundamental is the doctrine of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by Faith; which this opinion of Circumciſion to be a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace deſtroys, in that it holds forth another way to obtain Juſtification by, then faith, which is by carnal birth of believing pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:168338:39"/> For if a ſoul be admitted into a covenant of life thereby; I hope you are not ignorant, that juſtification by faith is the great privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the new covenant, and really the portion of all that are in that covenant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He here affirms two direct untruths: But whats that, when there is nothing elſe to be found in his whole book?</p>
               <p n="1">1 He tells us we hold another way of juſtification then faith, by carnal birth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which we abhor.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Another groſs untruth is, That Juſtification to life is the real portion, of all within the covenant of Grace.</p>
               <p>Therefore let the former diſtinction be ſtill minded; and then it is apparent, that we affirm no more, but that believers ſeed have right to the external part of the covenant of grace, which Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was a part of, as hath been proved: as for the ſpiritual part of the covenant, namely, that juſtification by faith, which he ſpeaks of; it hath ever been conveyed in a ſecret way of the ſpirits working upon the heart: from which it is evident, that perſons may be viſibly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the covenant, and yet have no real work of Grace in their ſouls, ſo as to be juſtifyed, as thoſe examples beforementioned do abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly prove, for then <hi>Judas</hi> had been really juſtifyed. Take in alſo the parallel; then al the members of their dipt ſocieties, would be real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly juſtifyed; had we nothing elſe to plead, but the ſenſible experience of theſe times; it would be enough to ſhew the falſity of ſuch an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion: for how many not onely of them, but of others alſo have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len away to diabolical deluſions? Thus far therefore we ſee thoſe foundations, by him pretended to be ſhaken, remain, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his high ſwelling language, untoucht, and unmoveable: — again</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> pag. 80, 81, 83. THis opinion deſtroys the doctrine and founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Goſpel-Churches. The matter there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which is Saints by calling, ſpiritual worſhippers, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.23. lively ſtones, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. perſons redeemed from a vain converſation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18. brought out of darkneſs into his marvellous light, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. Now this opinion brings in a whole Nation to be a Church, all born of their body, their ſeeds ſeed in their generations. This is a ſetting up the partition wall again, betwixt the natural branches, and thoſe that are wild by nature.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The manner of gathering is deſtroyed, and the Lords baptiſm neglected, and a counterfeit baptiſm ſet up in the room thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Though this head would require a larger anſwer, yet I ſhall contract as briefly as I can, therefore</p>
               <p n="1">1 As to the matter of a Goſpel Church, it is believers and their ſeed, which I thus prove: the Church of Chriſt is his kingdom in the world, to which the tenders of Goſpel-Grace and mercy belongs, it is therefore called the Goſpel of the kingdom, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.19. before toucht upon.</p>
               <p>It was ſo before the coming of Chriſt, and it is ſo ſince. If Grace therefore once took in children to be ſubjects of this kingdom, who then caſts them out? not Grace, for that is unchangeable, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they were taken in; Tis the Argument of <hi>Paul, If God juſtifies, who ſhall condemn,</hi> Rom. 8.31, 34. <hi>If God be for them, who ſhall be againſt them?</hi> If grace makes them holy, by ſeparating them to a holy uſe, who ſhall make them unclean, and cut them off? And that the ſame bowels of Grace and tender affection remains in Chriſt to little babes is cleer, under the Goſpel, <hi>for of ſuch is the kingdom;</hi> he doth not ſay of ſuch was the kingdom. For that indeed would have been quickly made uſe of as a plea againſt us. <hi>But of ſuch is the kingdom,</hi> As if he had ſaid, My Kingdome is made up of the ſame materials, as the Kingdomes of the World are, not onely of men and women, but of children alſo, <hi>of ſuch is the kingdome,</hi> would it not be ridiculous to ſay, there may be a kingdom without children? and that this is a metaphorical alluſion, to the kingdoms of the world
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:168338:40"/> is cleer, not onely from the words or phraſe there us'd, but alſo from other Texts, <hi>The kingdoms of the world, ſhall become the kingdoms of Chriſt.</hi> And <hi>Abrahams</hi> covenant tells us how it ſhould be, namely, <hi>by multiplying of Abrahams ſeed in all Nations,</hi> ſo as that power at laſt ſhall naturally divolve into their hands, as it is worthily obſerved by an eminent Miniſter of theſe times, Mr <hi>Carter</hi> upon <hi>Abrahams</hi> covenant.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider, the foundation of this kingdom was laid in <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed. For though God had his worſhip before, in families, from the beginning upon the firſt promiſe of Chriſt, yet it came not to a kingdom-worſhip till the promiſe was inlarged of multiplying the ſeed as the ſtars of heaven. And ſo <hi>Iſaac</hi> was taken in as a ſubject with his Father, though but an Infant-ſubject; and that covenant which took in them, was the kingdoms covenant; and the ſeal of the covenant, was the ſeal of the kingdom, which reaches as well Infant-ſubjects, as their Parents. If then the foundation of the kingdom were parents and children, then the building upon that foundation muſt be alſo parents and children, becauſe it is not a new but a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued kingdom, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.43. This being duly weighed, it will alſo reach to that other relation, the Church ſtands in to Chriſt, of being <hi>his houſe.</hi> And ſo takes in the place quoted, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. <hi>And ye as living ſtones are built up a ſpiritual houſe,</hi> &amp;c. Look what materials therefore were laid into the foundation of Gods ſpiritual houſe, of the ſame is it carryed up, till the top-ſtone be laid; with ſhoutings, Grace, Grace; And that Gods houſe, under the Law, was a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al huuſe, and their worſhippers, ſpiritual worſhippers, is c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Therefore, what ranks or degrees of people there were in the houſe of prayer then; the ſame was alſo the houſe of prayer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel in all Nations to conſiſt of: namely, of <hi>men, women,</hi> and <hi>children:</hi> therefore the Apoſtle calls the Church the houſhold of faith: in which are taken in believers ſeed: this doth alſo anſwer that place, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. ſpiritual worſhippers, for ſuch they were under the Law; and yet their children alſo were included. The word is there uſed in oppoſition to this or that place, which they lookt upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves bound up to, though Chriſt was come; as alſo in oppoſition to their manner of worſhip; which was then more carnal, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.10. Truth was alſo oppoſed to the Idol worſhip of the Samaritans; but nothing at all can be gathered to take away the right of children: or that imports children not to be fit matter for a Church, kingdom, or houſe of God; eſpecially conſidering it was the ſame covenant of Grace then that took them in, as it is now; and if it be an immutable covenant to believers and their ſeed, as no ſound Chriſtian can deny, then are believers ſeed ſtill in the covenant. And thus alſo children may be truely called <hi>Saints,</hi> and ſanctifyed perſons; holy, becauſe ſet apart to a holy uſe in the ſervice of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Whereas therefore he ſaith, this opinion brings in a whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of believers, it is his miſtake; for till God brings them in, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion and practice doth not; for it is but the incorporating of the families of believers, into Congregational Societies and Churches, unleſs there be ſo many families as fill a Nation, and then I think without offence, they may be called a Nation of believers; and for ought I can ſee, not improperly a National-Church; neither are we hound by <hi>Iſraels</hi> practice of Circumciſing, to their ſucceeding gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, who had a command for it, (though I believe they were much corrupted in that Ordinance, as appears from that place, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44.7.) therefore to baptize our children to ſucceed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Therefore alſo by natural branches, we are to underſtand the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh believing Parents and ſeed.

(<hi>and if ſome of the branches were broken off</hi> implying that as Parent and ſeed were branches, ſo ſome of thoſe branches were not broken off, but ſtill remained in <hi>Abrahams</hi> covenant, Therefore</p>
               <p n="2">2 By wild branches, <hi>or branches wild by nature,</hi> we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Gentiles, Parents and ſeed, called wild by nature; becauſe <hi>Iſrael</hi> that were Gods Vineyard, Orchard, Garden, and ſo incloſed, were dreſs'd and prun'd by Chriſt in his Miniſtry, who was the vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſer thereof, when as the Gentiles grew wild as a Tree in a wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſo were <hi>without God in the world, thus the natural branches were cut off, That the branches wild by nature might be graffed in.</hi> The Sun at noon day hath not ſo cleer a light, as this Scripture hath to prove the covenant right and intereſt of believers and their ſeed.

For by natural branches he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands onely adult profeſſors: and by branches wild by nature, little infants; when as the word of God tells us, that we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand by branches, Parents and Children. By all which, it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent that he underſtands not what the partition wa l is, or what the natural branches or branches wild by nature ſignifies. Thus far we have examined the t uth of his Church-matter. The next thing is the form, Therefore</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> The holding of this opinion that believers ſeed have a right to the covenant, makes people live in a neglect of the Lords baptiſm, contenting themſelves with a counterfeit baptiſm inſtead thereof
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:168338:42"/> and thus the Church comes to be conſtituted of good and bad pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly; and then he calls for our rule to juſtifie it.</p>

               <p n="2">2 It hath been alſo proved, that ſuch a mixture as is made by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in believers and their ſeed, is no more then what the word of God bars out, upon the account of <hi>Abrahams</hi> covenant: and to call it a mixture is to call that common which is clean.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Neither do I believe, but if their own Societies were ſifted, there would be found more chaff then wheat, and that their Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons would not appear more ſtrict then ours; I ſpeak not this by way of boaſting, for I doubt, we have not ſo much cauſe on either hand.</p>

                  <hi>P.</hi> p. 82. He tells us of going in an untrodden path, becauſe we baptize children, and receive them into the Church as members, and yet deny them the Sacrament. And then asks us when we will give it them? or why they have a right to one priviledge, and not to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Though a child may not be fit to ſit at the fathers Table, yet he may be fit to ſuck at the mothers breaſts. And if you will know when they ſhall come to the Lords Table, the Apoſtle tells you, when they can examine themſelves, 1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 11.28.</p>
               <p>Look back to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> though their ſeed did receive the ſeal of the covenant, and were admitted then in Chriſts kingdom, yet they were not preſently fit for the paſsover, which was alſo a ſpiritual feaſt, and a prefiguration of the Lords Supper, 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 5.7, 8. as the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God then, in which children were included; was a prefiguration of Gods <hi>Iſrael</hi> now; therefore though baptiſm, and the Lords Supper are both priviledges of the covenant, as Circumciſion and the Paſsover
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:168338:42"/> were then; yet the infant-ſeed of the kingdom may be fit for the one, though not fit for the other; as the infant-ſubjects of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the world: they are ſubjects, but not fit for all the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of a kingdom, which conſideration doth anſwer his cavils; though much more might have been added upon another account. As to that Scripture <hi>Act.</hi> 2.41, 42. <hi>That all that were baptized continued in breaking bread.</hi> I anſwer, They were ſuch there ſpoken of, that were capable of hearing the word, and which gladly received it; that were converted from Judaiſm. The like to which is practiſed upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of any unbaptiſed perſons at this day: and this makes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for us, for though their children were admitted in upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>Abrahams</hi> covenant, <hi>The promiſe is to you and your children;</hi> yet we do not finde they were admitted to the Supper: becauſe the ſame promiſe belonging to them and their ſeed under the Law, yet the ſeed were not capacifyed for the Paſsover. By all which, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it appears our path lies plain and open, that we may ſee which way the footſteps of the flock have gone before us; whereas if the blind lead the blind, they both tumble into a ditch or River. And thus both the matter and form of a true Goſpel-Church is maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by our doctrine and practice.</p>

                  <hi>P.</hi> That perſons may have a right to a covenant of life, without an in-being in Chriſt by faith, and is it not therefore a ſad thing, that perſons that profeſs themſelves Miniſters, and to have knowledge in the Goſpel, ſhould be ſo blinded as to miſlead people in ſo weighty a point as this is, and that they ſhould endeavor to leaven thouſands of people with ſuch a ſad error as oppoſeth it ſelf againſt the ſubſtance of the Goſpel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:168338:43"/> may doubt ſuch words are but preludiums to a remaining Tragedy. I ſpeak the more in this, becauſe I have alſo ſeen a piece called the <hi>Kings of the Eaſt,</hi> which may be rather called the devils pleading for a Pulpit; in which, when he ſpeaks to the Miniſters for licence to make uſe of them, he tells us if they will not give leave, they ſhall be prayed down and pulled down. But I hope they rage the more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have but a ſhort time.</p>
               <p>But to come to the anſwer:</p>
               <p>What he hath here ſaid, is of the ſame nature with what he hath ſpoken before, and ſo hath been already anſwered. Before he charged our baptiſm to be a counterfeit baptiſm, and here again our Miniſters are blinde, and miſleade thouſands to oppoſe the ſubſtance of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel. What taunting bold language is this, and how unfit for a man of his thred-bare knowledge and profeſſion? I hope the reader will excuſe me, becauſe it is to ſpeak a word for thoſe choice leaders of Chriſts flock; who are as ſheep dumb before the ſhearers of our times.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The former diſtinction of the covenant muſt be ſtill minded, and then it is apparent, that the charge put in againſt our Miniſtery is falſe. I have been one of their followers above this 12 yeers, I bleſs God, I never heard ſuch a doctrine delivered: That propagation gave an in-being in the ſpiritual part of the covenant of Grace, which is that M. <hi>P,</hi> intends by the covenant of life. Therefore what the Prophet ſaid to <hi>Ahab,</hi> is not miſ-applyed to him; <hi>It is he, and ſuch like as he, That are the troublers of Iſrael,</hi> That <hi>leavens</hi> the Nations with errors. <hi>That run before they are ſent: for he whom God hath ſent, ſpeaks the things of God;</hi> he ſpeaks not the things of God, becauſe he underſtands them not, as hath been made appear hitherto, he underſtands not the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace from works; what the new covenant is, the extent thereof, how to baptize, or whom to baptize. And therefore with the falſe Prophets, he teaches to revolt from God and his ways.</p>
               <p>The Reader may by this time ſee, what wood, hay, and ſtubble he hath built, that not one Argument hitherto, either to prove our pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice to overthrow the forenamed Fundamenta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>P.</hi> THe third head propounded to be proved by him, was, that none but believers had or ſhall have a right to the covenant of Grace; to prove which, he tells us that ſo ſoon as the ſeed of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was promiſed to our firſt Parents, after the fall, the Lord immediately made an outward covenant of Works, which was typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and intayled upon the fleſh, out of which Chriſt was to come; which was more dark till <hi>Abrahams</hi> days: then till <hi>Moſes</hi> more cleer: and then from <hi>Moſes</hi> it brake forth cleerly; and ſo continued till Chriſt, in whom it ceas'd and ended.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That thoſe typical Ceremonies by him called a covenant of works, was part of the covenant of Grace, hath been fully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; Therefore lets keep the old diſtinction, and hold faſt the form of ſound words, to caſt off which is of as dangerous a conſequence, as to ſtrip the Barke from the Tree, and then let the other grow if it can.

                     <item>I. God made a covenant of works with <hi>Adam,</hi> which he broke.</item>

Thus it is apparent what a rock of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and hereſie, we ſhould at laſt ſplit upon, by imbracing ſuch fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtical notions as this patron of plunging, would dowſe us into; Therefore let the Reader obſerve that <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. and he ſhall finde the typical worſhip was then made acceptable to God by believing, as our Ordinances are now; which had it been a covenent of works, it would have ſtood directly oppoſed to faith; <hi>therefore it was of faith, that it might be by grace.</hi> But when he ſpeaks of a covenant of works, then, <hi>If it be of works, it is no more of Grace, otherwiſe Grace is no more Grace:</hi> And take alſo a brief touch of the parallel of that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, which was the old covenant, and ſo of works.</p>
               <p>Then, as before, the Goſpel-adminiſtration muſt be a new covenant of works. And ſo what M. <hi>P.</hi> doth (though onely a pretender to Goſpel-rule) in wading into mill-pools and Rivers muſt be, as indeed it is, a branch of ſuch a covenant of Works. Therefore not of Grace:</p>

                  <hi>P.</hi> pag. 87, 88. The reaſon why God made choice of <hi>Abrahams</hi> family, and not <hi>Lots,</hi> or any of the reſt of the godly families in the world, it was not becauſe <hi>Abraham</hi> was any more a believer or his Family; for then <hi>Lot</hi> and his family, and the reſt had been taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the covenant of Circumciſion, becauſe they did believe as well as <hi>Abraham.</hi> For this is a ſure rule, If God gives a promiſe or command to a perſon as a believer; then whoſoever believes, that command and promiſe belongs to them: and for this he brings the example of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua,</hi> I will not leave thee, which the Apoſtle applyes to the Church <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. now the covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> was therefore to ſhew the world that Chriſt muſt come out of his fleſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Though I grant that <hi>Abraham</hi> was not pitcht upon as a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever barely; yet had he not been a believer, he could not have been the father of the faithful.</p>
               <p n="2">2 If that had been all, to point out to the world from whence they might expect the Meſſias; then Cir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So that the world would be at as great a loſs, to know in which of al theſe twelve the line was to run. Therefore if we do but look into the grounds of the Promiſes, we ſhall finde, there were many other main
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:168338:44"/> and choice ends; as namely, By the multiplying of believers, as the ſtars of heaven; who alſo are called the ſeed; they might thereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come bleſſings to families and Nations. For as Jeſus Chriſt was the great bleſſing, ſo every believer was alſo to be a little bleſſing; Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the promiſe, <hi>I will bleſs thee, and thou ſhalt be a bleſſing:</hi> and by this means God makes uſe of believers to be as his leaven, <hi>to lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the whole lump:</hi> ſo that in this way Chriſts <hi>kingdom</hi> ſhall at laſt ſpread through the earth.</p>
               <p n="2">2 To make <hi>Abraham</hi> a publike Father, to the believing Gentiles and their ſeed ſince the coming of Chriſt, as he was to the Jews and their ſeed before Chriſt came.</p>
               <p n="3">3 To ſeal the poſſeſſion of <hi>Canaan</hi> to him and the heirs of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe as a type of heaven, and to give them poſſeſſion of that Land in a way of conqueſt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.17. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.73.</p>
               <p n="4">4 To ſhew the immutability of his counſel and purpoſe to the Gentiles, <hi>Heirs with him of the ſame promiſes,</hi> that ſo, we in Goſpel days, might have ground of conſolation in all ſtraits and extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that the heirs under the Goſpel might meet with, becauſe they alſo have a <hi>wilderneſs</hi> to go through <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.6: and <hi>Canaanites</hi> to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due and conquer <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.27. And a like <hi>reſt</hi> with that of <hi>Canaan</hi> to poſſeſs <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.1. Therefore <hi>Abraham</hi> is held out as a publike Father to look at, thereby to ſee and behold Gods variety of dealings with him, and with his ſeed after him, either in war, or peace; proſperity, or adverſity, hereby to ſtrengthen Faith in the like caſe: that ſo as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, one deep may call out to another at the noiſe of Gods water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpouts, when the billows overflow.</p>
               <p>Theſe, and all theſe, and more then theſe were the ends for which God made choice of <hi>Abraham</hi> to give the Promiſes unto, with the oath, and ſeal; all which do ſubſtantially continue to this day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Chriſt handed over to the Gentiles, with the old ſeal taken off, which as Lord of all, he had power to do, and a new ſeal added in the room thereof, to the ſame covenant, which amounts to no more then the taking off a ſeal of red wax from a covenant, and putting a ſeal of white wax in the place thereof; yet the covenant ſtill <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. To that which he ſaith, that if a command or promiſe be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to a believer, as a believer, it then (as a ſure rule) belongs to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one that is a believer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That's no true rule, therefore not a ſure rule; becauſe a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that ſuits to one mans condition as a believer, doth not therefore
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:168338:45"/> ſuit with every believers condition: neither doth the end of God, in giving one believer a Promiſe, reach to the ſame end in all believers, unleſs ſo circumſtantiated; as for inſtance;</p>
               <p>God gave <hi>Abraham</hi> Circumciſion as a believer. And his end was to make <hi>Abraham</hi> a publike Father: yet this did not therefore reach to all believers. For he did not intend to make any more publike fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the s then one; the like we may ſay of that inſtance he gives of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua:</hi> The command and Promiſe given to him, was as a Captain General and believer; and ſo it could not reach to all believers upon thoſe terms, for though he was commanded to be of a good cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and fight, and he ſhould not be forſaken, yet that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand doth not reach to all believers; becauſe we ſee many believers have fallen in the wars, and their enemies have been the conquerors; yea ſuch a command would then reach to women, becauſe they are believers: And the reaſon why that promiſe was applyed to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Hebrews, is becauſe one promiſe hath ſeveral aſpects. And ſo ſuits to ſeveral conditions, it being as a ſprig of the whole bundle that ſuits all conditions. So, the ſeveral cures that Chriſt wrought upon perſons as believers, and ſome in a way of promiſe, doth not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fo e inſtate all believers in ſuch a promiſe, that they ſhall ſo be cured; when the holy Ghoſt tells us <hi>the prayer of faith ſhall ſave the ſick</hi> doth this give al believers an intereſt into the direct intent of that promiſe? there is therefore much Chriſtian prudence to be obſerved in chuſing, and applying promiſes, to pick out ſuch as are ſuitable to a believers condition.</p>
               <p>The Reader may therefore ſee, how ſadly confident and ignorant this man is; who yet, is lookt upon, as the <hi>Nicodemus</hi> of that party.</p>

                  <hi>P.</hi> pag. 86. For many pages he goes on to ſhew that the whole line by promiſe, mentioned in <hi>Luke</hi> 3. it was onely an external electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into a covenant of works, and <hi>Cain, Ham, Iſhmael, Eſau,</hi> were therefore outwardly rejected from that covenant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It hath been already proved that all the line by promiſe are more then externally elected; yea ſo to affirm is ſtrongly to ſuppoſe, that ſome of that elect line might be damned, becauſe thouſands ſo elected are never ſaved, and ſome of thoſe ſo rejected might go to heaven though tis expreſly againſt the ſcriptures: the naming of which methinks ſhould be a ſufficient confutation.</p>
               <p>As to the ſix ſons of <hi>Keturah,</hi> which he ſpeaks of in page 90, which were <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, and ſent away into the eaſt Country:</p>

               <p>The anſwer is plain, that ſo long as they were in <hi>Abrahams</hi> family and Circumciſed, they were all Church-members and viſibly in the covenant, as their brother <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was; but being turnd out of the family, they loſt the Church priviledges, as not being heirs of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; as for their being gracious, we have no ground to think they were, but the contrary. And had <hi>Iſhmael, Eſau,</hi> and <hi>Keturahs</hi> ſons, been kept within the covenant, there had then been no partition wall betwixt Jew, and Gentile.

And ſo the Apoſtle after argues, <hi>To you firſt God hath ſent his ſon, to bleſs you:</hi> and if the Jews firſt, then the Gentiles afterwards; yea when it came to the Gentiles, there was a divine order in conveighing this bleſſing, falling like the ſhowrs of heaven, ſometimes in one Country, ſometimes in another.

               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> Pag. 92.93. He again harps upon the old ſtring thus: Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion was not given to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed, conſidered as a believer, but to ſhew us that the Meſſias was to come from <hi>Abraham,</hi> not from <hi>Lot;</hi> from <hi>Iſaac,</hi> not <hi>Iſhmael;</hi> from <hi>Jacob,</hi> not <hi>Eſau;</hi> therefore here you may nakedly ſee how groſly they miſtake, that think the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant was made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed, conſidered as a believer, and believers ſeed; therefore if a national covenant was made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed upon this reaſon, before, then you cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that <hi>Abrahams</hi> covenant belongs to any Gentile; becauſe when Chriſt was come, and the ground upon which the covenant was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:168338:46"/> ceaſing, the covenant alſo ceaſeth: ſo that now to defend a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant in the fleſh, is a doctrine virtually to deny that Chriſt is come: and hence therefore we may conclude that there was no covenant of grace made with any but ſuch as did and do believe: that objection therefore, that ſpiritual priviledges under the Goſpel, are not leſs then they were under the Law, is hereby anſwered.</p>

It therefore appears, the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace is of ſuch extent, that it takes in thouſands into the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible part thereof, that ſhall never be ſaved; ſo that ſtill the objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which he ſaith is anſwered, remains in full force and vertue, that the priviledges are not ſtraitned more then they were under the Law: therefore as children were then in covenant, and received the ſeal, ſo are they ſtill in covenant, and the Goſpel ſeal is their due, and cannot be denyed them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> Pag 94. The new covenant was confirmed of God in Chriſt onely, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.17. therefore it cannot belong unto any ſouls out of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 11.25. This cup is the new Teſtament in my blood: If the New Teſtament be in Chriſts blood, then what hath any carnal unbelieving wretch to do with this Teſtament, that hath not faith in his blood?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Theſe Texts makes full againſt him. For that place, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.17. tells us that <hi>Abrahams covenant which was</hi> 430 <hi>yeers before the Law, was confirmed in Chriſts blood. Therefore the Law coming after, could not make the Promiſes of God of none effect:</hi> If then <hi>Abrahams</hi> cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in which children were included, were confirmed in that blood; this new covenant being the ſame with <hi>Abrahams,</hi> as himſelf confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, and confirmed by the ſame blood, Infants are ſtill within the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:168338:47"/> ſame covenant. For the covenant is in Chriſt, Yea and Amen to all the perſons included in the covenant. As there is a double being in the covenant; internal, and external: ſo a double being in Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.3, 4 which being well diſtinguiſht, will cleer all ſuch doubts. Some of the ſeed are onely in Chriſt externally, as <hi>Iſhmael, Eſau,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; Internally alſo, as <hi>Iſaac, Jacob,</hi>  and ſo in the covenant, whether Adult or Infants: the like to be ſaid to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.25. That cup is the New Teſtament, or a ſeal of the New-Teſtament to all that are within that Teſtament. As Chriſts blood typically ſealed the firſt Teſtament to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed, ſo Chriſts blood ſeals the New-Teſtament to believers and their ſeed; of which that cup is the Sacramental remembrance: the like alſo to <hi>Mat.</hi> 3 17. my ſon in whom I am well pleaſed, <hi>i. e.</hi> as God was well pleaſed with <hi>Abraham</hi> &amp; his ſeed by promiſe, that were in the covenant co firmed by Chriſts blood; ſo is he now well pleaſed with believers, and their ſeed by promiſe in the ſame covenant confirmed by Chriſts blood. The ſame anſwer is to be given to all the reſt of thoſe places by him quoted, with which he fills many pages, to prove that none can be in the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace except he be firſt in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> In pag. 95. He condoles the ſadneſs of theſe times. That when the means of grace, and knowledge of the Goſpel, is ſo plentifully held forth; yet we muſt be forc'd to beſtow ſuch pains to prove that men cannot be in a ſtate of ſalvation, and acceptation before God in a covenant of Grace, without union with Chriſt by Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Alas poor man, he would fain be pittyed for the pains he takes, but who is it that puts him to it, but his own erring ſpirit which makes him afraid of his own ſhadow? Is there any of us that affirms ſo wickedly, that acceptation is to be had in God, without union with Chriſt? If not; he deals the more deceitfully to ſuggeſt ſuch things, as if our Miniſtry did it. Therefore</p>

For how can ſuch hold forth the means of Grace, that ſhall affirm ſuch an acceptation is to be had without ſuch an union? which he affirms to be the principles of thoſe that plead for infant-baptiſm: but bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be God, If you have no better warrant to juſtifie your irregular and unnatural practice withal, and condemn ours, then ſuch ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies; the experience of theſe days ſpeaks aloud, who it is, that have held forth the means of Grace, and glorious light of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:168338:48"/> It is evident enough from the budding and fructility of <hi>Aarons</hi> rod, of whom it may be ſaid, they preach with Authority and not as the Scribes, for their rods are dry and barren; becauſe they preach not converſion, but ſubverſion.</p>
               <p>I ſhall touch upon a Scripture or two more, leaving the reſt for the Reader to anſwer in his own thoughts. For indeed not one of them proves any thing he aſſerts; <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.6. <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.14. He that hath Chriſt hath life, he that hath not Chriſt hath not life; we ſay the ſame: but he that hath not Chriſt ſpiritually, may have a viſible right to the covenant of Grace, as thoſe hypocrites had, ſo often menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned. So in their own.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> So he quotes <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. that Chriſt calls the unbelievers in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church of the Jews, the world; <hi>I have choſen you out of the world;</hi> and their being circumciſed, freed them not from being juſtly ſo called.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The anſwer is, The words are directed to the Diſciples, as a people that acknowledged Chriſt exhibited, and ſo were Goſpel wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers. And the unbelievers amongſt the Anabaptiſts may as well be called the world, if the compariſon relates to one that truely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, as the Jews were called the world, when Chriſts words rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his real believing Diſciples. For the denying of Chriſt to be the Meſſias, was that which diſtinguiſht; becauſe ſuch a denyal led them to keep up a form of worſhip, that did directly oppoſe the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> Another Scripture <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.16. <hi>It is of faith, that it might be by grace:</hi> but if the covenant was made to the ſeed; it could not be of faith, and ſo not of grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Here is ſad work made in his interpretations: was it not of Faith to <hi>Abraham</hi> that it might be by Grace, to him and his ſeed? for ſhame abuſe not the Scripture ſo groſly: <hi>It was of Faith that it might be by grace, to the end the Promiſe might be ſure to all the ſeed;</hi> and who this ſeed was, he tells us, <hi>little children,</hi> if we may draw it from <hi>Iſaacs</hi> being a child, in <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſhall thy ſeed be called. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Gentiles ſhall know that the word <hi>ſeed</hi> reaches them, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he adds, not to that onely which is of the Law, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that as it was <hi>to Abraham by faith, that it might be of Grace to his ſeed:</hi> So is it now of Faith to a believer that it might be of Grace to his ſeed.</p>
               <p>So alſo he quotes <hi>Act.</hi> 15.4. <hi>He put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:168338:48"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> If God put no difference, how durſt he do it then?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> So <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.2, 4. <hi>we are all one in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> How then can he anſwer it before God, to make us twain? For as <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed through the Law, were in covenant, ſo are believers and their ſeed now: or elſe we are not all one in Chriſt, but two ſeeds.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> As for that oppoſition he gives page 99.. That a temporal ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction into a temporal covenant, was a type of the ſpiritual election into a ſpiritual covenant:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is a whimſey of his own brain, that can never be made good, and therefore it ſhews a giddy ſpirit after notions. —</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> Again, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. <hi>without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God;</hi> therefore none can be in a covenant of Grace but ſuch as believe. So <hi>Abel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> We pleaſe God by Faith now, as thoſe worthies in that chap. mentioned did then; for therefore the Apoſtle brings in them for an example: ſo the anſwer is ſtill the ſame. Look how <hi>Abraham</hi> our Father pleaſed God, in circumciſing his ſeed as in the covenant, in which there was an act of Faith, and how the contrary in <hi>Moſes</hi> neglecting the ſeal diſpleaſed God; ſo are believers to pleaſe God by ſealing their ſeed, and the neglect hereof provokes the wrath of God, as it is evident from this example: by which we ſee that if we would pleaſe God as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, we muſt then walk in the ſteps of <hi>Abraham:</hi> and it is agreeable, and not oppoſite to faith, or grace, to ſeal our Infants.</p>
               <p>Thus Chriſtian Reader, thou maiſt ſee all the Scriptures by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf quoted to maintain his opinions: they do like the ſtars of heaven in their courſes fight againſt this <hi>Siſera.</hi>

But therefore the word <hi>children</hi> is kept in to ſhew the ſpecial privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges God hath given them when the parent is converted. And then the ſenſe runs cleer, Repent and be baptized, <hi>For the promiſe is to you and your children,</hi> and to them that are afar off, <hi>even as many as the Lord our God ſhall call,</hi> in a ſmooth Honorable ſtile becoming the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel: thus we ſee, that rather then he will make his ſenſe ſtoop to Gods word he will make the Holy Ghoſt ſtoop to his Non-ſenſe.</p>
               <p>From which therefore we may gather (notwithſtanding his inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating perſwaſions, that this Text makes againſt us) it is abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cleer that this promiſe here ſpoken of, is that of <hi>Abrahams</hi> cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which the Apoſtle <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. explains to be a Goſpel-covenant, and was confirmed by Chriſt 430 yeers before the Law: ſo that ſtill the reſult amounts to this, That if it be <hi>Abrahams</hi> covenant, it muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey the bleſſings of the covenant to all within the covenant, that is, to the ſpiritual ſeed, ſpiritual bleſſings; to the temporal ſeed, external priviledges onely: but ſtill by one covenant.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. To come to the Scriptures before brought: his intent thereby was, to prove that the promiſe of remiſſion of ſins, and the gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, and ſo juſtification to life belongs to all thoſe which God ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>A.</hi> He errs, not obſerving the Scriptures, nor the diſtinctions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Gods call is two fold; <hi>External,</hi> and <hi>internal:</hi> yet ſo as that the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:168338:50"/> latter is conveyed in the former: and ſure a man muſt needs groſly miſtake, to affirm that all that are called are juſtifyed, and their ſins remitted: for then <hi>Judas</hi> had been juſtifyed, and <hi>Simon</hi> the Sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer ſaved (for they were both called, and both baptized) yea all that are called everywhere to repent, would then be juſtifyed; and all thoſe Apoſtates that are in theſe days fallen from the truth, would be all ſaved, for they were all called; ſo the fooliſh virgins were called.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let it be conſidered, that the promiſe of <hi>Abrahams</hi> covenant is here held forth. Now all that are viſibly called to embrace the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, are not effectually called; though nevertheleſs all that are ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually called are within that covenant. The Church at <hi>Rome, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth, Galatia, Epheſus,</hi> the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> were all cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led viſibly within the covenant, but we know they were not all effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually called; we may then ſtill ſee how ſadly M. <hi>P.</hi> mangles the Scriptures, when he brings proofes that relate to an effectual call, to prove that all that are called (without any diſtinction) ſhall be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and ſaved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo that if he can but finde out the word <hi>call</hi> in a Text; tis enough: no matter how it is applyed.</p>

                  <hi>P.</hi> Pag. 130.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> We never affirmed that remiſſion of ſins, or eternal life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to any but ſuch as are effectually called; therefore the ſpirit of deluſion and ignorance, yea the ſpirit of impudence hath ſeized upon him, ſo to affirm. But this we ſay, that all that are viſibly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to embrace the tenders of the Goſpel by a viſible ſubjecting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, are within <hi>Abrahams</hi> covenant: for we cannot imagine that all the Apoſtles baptized were really called: for the Sorcerer before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned doth ſufficiently confute it; therefore ſtill he miſtakes the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, which is thus, whether all that are called are really juſtifyed?</p>
               <p n="2">2 Neither can it be reaſonably thought, that there were no hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites amongſt thoſe three thouſand mentioned, and that they were all ſo called as he ſpeaks of; but the Apoſtles intention was to let them know, by what way they might get in to <hi>Abrahams</hi> covenant again, from which both they and their ſeed were cut off; <hi>Therefore
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:168338:51"/> Repent and be baptized, for the remiſſion of ſin; and ye ſhall receive the gift of the Holy Ghoſt. For the promiſe is to you and your children,</hi> &amp;c. That is, remiſſion of ſins, and the gift of the Spirit comes ſtill in the way of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Covenant, as it did before, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.14. Therefore if you will get into the way of the Spirits working; you muſt repent and be baptized: he doth not ſay that all baptized do really repent; for upon the ground Mr. <hi>Patient</hi> goes, none ſhould be admitted to baptiſm but ſuch as really Repent, and are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally called, and really juſtifyed; when as yet he forgets his own ignorance, That he is not able to diſcern th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And upon the whole we finde it to be a tender of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Covenant, in all the bleſſings of it, even to children of viſible believers, either Jews or Gentiles; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſeal of that Covenant is their due Right and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>

                  <hi>P.</hi> The next Text is, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. which he ſaith we abuſe, to make it ſpeak for Infant-holineſs. <hi>Elſe were your children unclean, but now they are holy.</hi> God takes perſons into Covenant two ways, either by an external typical Covenant of Works, as he did <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſo a people may be ſaid to be holy by ſeparation, as the carnal Jew being ſeparated from the world: and thus the veſſels of the Temple were holy, and the Prieſt were holy.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Secondly, A new-Covenant holineſs when God writes his Laws in the heart, and ſanctifies their Nature; and there is no other kinde of holineſs that relates to the new Covenant but this; Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites may have this in appearance, but the Elect onely have it in truth; therefore it is impoſſible, that a believers carnal ſeed ſhould be ſo holy by Birth.

Therefore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle writing to the Churches as ſeparated people, calls them Saints or holy ones, at <hi>Rome, Corinth, Galatia,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> There is no ſuch thing mentioned in either place, that their children were Baſtards. Then had <hi>Moſes</hi> ſon by <hi>Zipporah</hi> the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian been a Baſtard; yea the contrary is evident, becauſe the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture calls them wives. And is it not a wilde expreſſion to call her whore, that Gods word calls a wife? And would it not be as ſtrange, to think that ſo many Prieſts and Levites ſhould be whoremaſters, which yet muſt be, if ſuch an interpretation were true, as Mr. <hi>Patient</hi> gives?</p>
               <p>But therefore the ground of putting away their ſtrange wives, was becauſe <hi>Iſrael</hi> was a ſeparated people, and ſo not to have any affinity with ſtrangers.

               <p>Let no man therefore diſlike the truth for this Bears skin which this Author of dipping hath caſt upon it.

                  <hi>A.</hi> As all other places of Scripture hitherto brought, have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed by falſe explications, and applications, ſo is the intent and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Text much wrong'd, and clouded: I ſhall therefore briefly cleer it.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle is telling the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> that the Jew had no more benefit by the death of Chriſt then the Gentile; for both Jew and Gentile were all under ſin, and were therefore all dead, <hi>If one dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for all, then were all dead.</hi> It ſeems many of them thought, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:168338:54"/> Chriſt came from the Jews, therefore he did bear more love to them then the Gentiles; and ſo it was good being a Jew. To which <hi>Paul</hi> anſwers, True, if we that are Jews ſhould judge after the fleſh according to our natural affection to our own Nation, then we ſhould ſay ſo too: but the love of Chriſt conſtrains us to judge otherwiſe, that is, he did not look upon the benefit of this or that Nation pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly; but this Chriſt had in his eye, Jew and Gentile were all dead: and upon this account did Chriſt die. <hi>For if one dyed for all, then were all dead:</hi> as if he had ſaid, Chriſt did not intend this Jew ſhould be more priviledged then that Gentile, though himſelf were a Jew: <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore henceforth know we no man after the fleſh,</hi> That is, we do not now look upon the Jew, to have any more priviledge then the Gentiles, <hi>yea though we have known Chriſt after the fleſh,</hi> that is, though we have known him to be a Jew, and to receive the ſeal of their priviledges on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>yet henceforth we know him ſo no more,</hi> that is, we have no more pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge now by Chriſts coming from us, then the Gentiles; nor hath Chriſt any more income of priviledges from us, then he hath from the Gentiles; ours is alike from him, and his is alike from us, and no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. And that this is the true intent of the words, ſee v. 17, 18, 19, 20. <hi>Old things are paſt away,</hi> i. e. old priviledges, that we claimed in Chriſt before others, they are all now conveyed over to the world: and therefore <hi>he hath committed to us the Goſpel of reconciliation, to wit, that God was in Chriſt reconciling the world to himſelf,</hi> i. e. It was onely our Nation that was reconciled, before Parents and children called his ſons, ſpouſe, off-ſpring, heirs; the bleſſings of the covenant were ours onely. But now all this is tendered to the world, <hi>Therefore we as Embaſſadors in Chriſts ſtead beſeech you to be reconciled.</hi> And thus you have this innocent Text which hath been turned againſt <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> ſeed (though it harbors not a harſh ſyllable to babes) wreſted out of the paw of the Lyon.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> He appears miſtaken: for our Miniſters now, neither plead for Circumciſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor Juſtification by works which was the main rock, thoſe primitive Churches (by reaſon of the falſe teachers) were like to ſplit upon; yea it is a thing note worthy, that in all thoſe primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive revolts from the truth, the falſe Teachers did uſher them in, by preaching up Circumciſion, after the Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> by which means they made rents and diviſions in all Churches; ſo that, had not Infants been Church-members, that were ſtrongly riveted in their Parents affections, it could have been no taking Argument to Parental-members, to fall back to Judaiſm, or any probable ground of hopes to incourage the falſe Teachers in their works: for upon the ſtrain of Anabaptiſts they might have done as they pleaſed, with their children Circumciſe, or Paganize them; for they were not to be of the viſible Church til they were adult believers, and ſo converted to the Faith by the word preacht. And the very Text it ſelf doth imply that children in the Primitive times were called Diſciples; or elſe how ſhould it be called a putting a yoak upon the necks of the Diſciples, after the manner of <hi>Moſes?</hi> It was the childrens necks, that bore the yoak; <hi>Zipporah</hi> knew it right well: ſo that it is apparent, what he ſaith of our Miniſtery in comparing them to thoſe falſe Teachers, is but his uſual way of reproaches, in which he ſhakes hands with thoſe falſe Teachers mentioned, whoſe main work hath ever been to ſmite the ſhepheards, that the ſheep may be ſcattered; and to extinguiſh their light, that ſo their glow-worm ſhining may be ſeen in the dark.

This being premiſed, that <hi>Moſes</hi> was a Typical Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; and their baptiſm, and the Rock, and Manna a type of Chriſt: from hence the ſenſe of the Text is drawn plain, That as the ſpiritual diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or Iſraelite is baptized into Chriſt, ſo the temporal Iſraelite was baptized to <hi>Moſes</hi> in the cloud and ſea: and they are called ſpiritual meat and drink by a figure.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> He hath no way to put off his falſe doctrines, but by turning all Scriptures into allegorical notions: for what expoſition he hath here given is as much beſides the Text, and as unlikely to be true, as for me to ſay, the man in the Moon is like M. <hi>P.</hi> for let us but conſider, that thoſe Sacraments were ſpiritual to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as Gods Church, as the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of the Goſpel were ſpiritual to the Church of <hi>Corinth.</hi> Now the Apoſtle in drawing the parallel, doth not ſpeak of a ſpiritual
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:168338:56"/> Church in a carnal Church; or a ſpiritual Iſraelite, and a carnal Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elite; thereby making onely ſome to be baptized to <hi>Moſes,</hi> but tells as plainly they were all baptized to <hi>Moſes.</hi> Whereas, this whimſical notion would make us believe, there were ſome of Iſrael not bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed to <hi>Moſes:</hi> and when <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>they did all eat the ſame ſpiritual meat, and did all drink the ſame ſpiritual drink;</hi> M. <hi>P.</hi> tells us directly contrary. You ſee then with what evidence of truth he ſpeaks, when the Authority of an Apoſtle muſt vail before him: and though he ſaith the Sacraments are ſpiritual by a figure; yet if he were askt by what figure, he muſt either give a Parrots anſwer, or ſay nothing; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit he ſhews his ignorance to be medling, and his confidence (I am unwilling to call it worſe) to notionallize the Sacraments themſelves; as if they were not a ſpiritual meat, and a ſpiritual drink to the Church of God. By which we ſee, rather then he will have any dependance upon the Law, he will run beyond the Goſpel.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Now it is doubtful whether theſe children had believing Parents to the fift or ſixt generation; therefore if you make it to countenance that error of the covenant in the fleſh: that appears erroneous, in that the greateſt number of believe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That we have good grounds to judge their parents godly, hath before been made appear: but if this were all the difference, methinks a ſober is more becoming then a cenſorious judgement. — By king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God we are to underſtand the <hi>viſible Church:</hi> moſt properly of ſuch is the kingdom. For otherwiſe it had not been a ſuitable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, for their offence, in that it lyed in their not ſuffering children to be brought to him to receive an outward favor and bleſſing. They could not have hindered them from the kingdom of glory, but from the viſible Church they might; therefore Chriſt takes them up roughly, Suffer them to come unto me, and forbid them not. In which there is a double command, implying much heat of ſpirit againſt ſuch an action, and much love and tender affection to the babes, as if he had ſaid, do you that are my diſciples reject them, becauſe they are children? I would have you know for time to come, they are as ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of bleſſings as your ſelves. <hi>For of ſuch is the kingdom of God;</hi> my church &amp; kingdom is made up of ſuch, as well as of men and women.

               <p n="2">II. <hi>P.</hi> But how wide is that which remains, from the buſineſs, where he ſaith the greateſt number of believers ſeed never belonged to Gods kingdom, when as we know the very inſtances by him cited, do ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently prove, that the ſeed of believers, though they have proved vile and wicked, yet they did belong to the viſible Church and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, till by caſting out they were diſcovenanted.

               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> If children be admitted into the kingdom of God, by vertue of a covenant of life made by faith and generation, then this croſſeth the doctrine of the New-birth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.5.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> The contrary hath been already proved; for if that were true, how came that doctrine of the New-birth to be taught in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> by the place cited? and yet their ſeed were then admitted Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, as now.

This Objection is falſe and groundleſs, as appears by ſeveral expreſs Texts of Scripture which do evidently prove it two diſtinct covenants.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He here quarrels with the word <hi>adminiſtration,</hi> becauſe he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands it not, for though it be ſo cald, by reaſon the ſpiritual part runs therein, yet it loſeth not the name of a covenant; becauſe it is mans part of the covenant, and called Gods covenant; and yet it is Gods adminiſtration to man. For his grand miſtake is, in that he thinks the covenant of grace hath no conditions, but abſolute; the contrary to which is before proved. The Rainbow in the clouds is called Gods covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. As here circumciſion is called his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, but ſurely M <hi>P.</hi> will not deny but it is an adminiſtration, wherein Gods favor to the world is manifeſted; how elſe can it be called a token of the covenant, and a ſign thereof; as a ſo is circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion called a ſign and ſeal, and token of the covenant. And when God ſaith this is my covenant, he means not a diſtinct covenant from the other; but that part of the other which related to mans duty. And ſo it was Gods Adminiſtration Office to the world. I need not ſtand much upon this, becauſe it is ſo fully ſpoken to before, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving circumciſion no covenant of works.

He is there ſhewing the different eſtate that was betwixt Jew and Gentile in the things of God; and therefore when he ſpeaks to the Corinthians in ver. 2. he ſpeaks ſo as that he would have them underſtand the difference, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt true and falſe worſhippers, <hi>ye know brethren that ye were Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles carryed away to theſe dumb Idols, even as you were led.</hi> But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards having ſhewed that Chriſt was to have a myſtical Church-bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the world, which was to conſiſt of Jews and Gentiles; he tells us that in the compleating of this body there are different admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations; yet ſo as that both Jew and Gentile are baptized by one ſpirit into this one body. So that thoſe words, <hi>different adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> can relate to no more ſorts of people, but Jew and Gentile; and therefore can be but two; namely the Jewiſh or legal Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the Gentile, or Goſpel-Adminiſtration, and the baptiſm of the Holy Spirit of God working in both of them; and yet ſo, as that the Jews and their children, and the Gentiles and their children make up as one ſeed, this one body of the myſtical Church: ver. 12, 13, 38. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.14, 16. compared; and this different Adminiſtration came from Chriſt as Lord; therefore called the ſame Lord, implying that Chriſt as Lord gave <hi>Iſrael</hi> that typical Adminiſtration, and ſo Chriſt as Lord changed it, and ſet up a Goſpel-Adminiſtration: and in this ſenſe is Chriſt called the Lord alſo of the Sabboth-day; cleerly implying that what change hath been made of Sabboth-ſeals, or any other Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, it was done by the Prerogative-Royal of Jeſus Chriſt, as Lord thereof; for the uſe of that one body and Lordſhip of his (the Church:) by which we ſee there are two, and but two Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; which therefore as it may ſatisfie M. <hi>P.</hi> in the ſignificancy of the word, and yet remain as a covenant alſo; ſo doth it meet with that licencious rotten abuſe of this word, in making as many ſeveral adminiſtrations as there are new opinions in the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> p. 138. He brings many Scriptures to prove that Circumciſion is cald a covenant, not an adminiſtration, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7, 13. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.6, 7, 8. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Though God calls it not an adminiſtration, but a covenant, yet it becomes a covenant made with man by vertue of adminiſtration, and the meaning is no more but this, that Grace to man runs through thoſe Ordinances. If Circumciſion be a covenant, it muſt have an adminiſtrator, or elſe the covenant ceaſes. If it be a covenant to <hi>Iſaac,</hi> then <hi>Abraham</hi> muſt adminiſter it; ſo baptiſm is an Ordinance, yet
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:168338:61"/> had it no adminiſtrator, it would ceaſe to be an Ordinance: it is true there may be a neglect of an Ordinance, as there was of Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and yet the Ordinance continued, for they wanted not an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrator.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Though God called it not an adminiſtration in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. yet <hi>Paul</hi> called it ſo in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. as is before proved, and ſurely M. <hi>P.</hi> will not deny, but that <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake by the ſpirit of God when he ſo called it.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Tis alſo called an adminiſtration, in reference to the care and pains Gods people are to take in adminiſtring for their Fathers eſtate, left in a way of Will and Teſtament, which is to be made ſure into that <hi>adminiſtration-office</hi> of Gods Ordinances, both then under Law, and now under the Goſpel; according to 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 10, 11. <hi>For ſo an entrance ſhall be adminiſtred abundantly into the everlaſting kingdom.</hi> By all which therefore we ſee the word is proper, full, and ſignificant, only carpt at out of ignorance: that it remains to be a covenant, <hi>i. e.</hi> on mans part and an adminiſtration, <hi>i. e.</hi> the way God hath appointed to convey juſtification to life, and both theſe reaches Parents and children.</p>
               <p>As for all thoſe Scriptures he here brings to prove two covenants, and therefore one of works; they have been already anſwered, to which I refer the Reader, onely I ſhall take in one or two Scriptures in which he hath made ſad work, that have not been ſo fully anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before, becauſe I intended it for this place. The firſt is</p>
               <p>Pag. 140. Gal. 4.21. <hi>Tell me ye that deſire to be under the Law, Do ye not hear the Law? For it is written, that Abraham had two ſons, the one by a bond-maid, the other by a free woman; but he who was by the bond-maid was born after the fleſh, but he of the free-woman, was born by promiſe, which things are an Allegory,</hi> i. e. by theſe things other things are meant. <hi>For theſe are the two covenants: the one from Mount Sinai in Arabia, which gendreth to bondage, and anſwers to Jeruſalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children. But Jeruſalem which is above is free: which is the Mother of us all. Now, we brethren, as I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaac was, are children of the promiſe: but as then he that was after the fleſh, perſecuted him that was of the ſpirit, even ſo it is now; but what ſaith the Scripture? caſt out the bond-woman, and her ſon, for the ſon of the bondwoman ſhall not be heir with the ſon of the free: ſo then bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, we are not children of the bond-woman, but of the free.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> From hence obſerve, that <hi>Abraham</hi> is here a type of God, and his two wives, <hi>Sarah</hi> and <hi>Hagar</hi> with their two children, are a type of the two covenants, and the two ſeeds in thoſe covenants, and both

               <p>Again <hi>Abraham</hi> had firſt the free woman, and laſt the bond-wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; the free-woman was ſometimes barren in <hi>Abrahams</hi> houſe, the bond-woman was fruitful; the myſtery of all is this: Firſt God made a covenant of Grace, which proved barren.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He made a covenant of works in his Church, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved fruitful; that had abundance of ſeed which became his by nature without Faith, all which time the covenant of grace and works a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed well together in Gods houſe: but when the true <hi>Iſaac</hi> was born. <hi>i. e.</hi> Chriſt; without ſtrength of nature, but by faith in a promiſe; yet ſtill grace and works as two covenants dwelt together: but when Chriſt is weaned, <hi>i. e.</hi> come into the Miniſtery, then all the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>From hence it is plain, there were no carnal babes in the Church: but when Chriſt the true ſeed of grace was perſecuted by the Jews; he ſeed of the covenant of works, the Goſpel, doth plentifully hold forth the aboliſhing thereof, and caſting out thoſe bond-children out of the Church of God.</p>

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:168338:63"/> So the Law ceremonial, when made a covenant of works, and the Law moral alſo, in that abuſive ſenſe was to be caſt out of the Church of God, both under the Law, and under the Goſpel. But as <hi>Sarah</hi> was contented to have <hi>Hagar</hi> dwell with her a ſervant, ſo in that ſenſe did the law ceremonial &amp; moral attend grace, being in truth the Law of Chriſt. But as a covenant of works, it could not make one heir of promiſe; Therefore it was but a fooliſh thing for the Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians to think by works to merit heaven: for there was never any man ſaved by works, <hi>ch.</hi> 3.11. But if your heart and affections be ſet that way, it genders to bondage, and makes you fruitful to hell, &amp; ſo leaves you under the curſe of God, <hi>v.</hi> 24, 25. look upon <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem and her children,</hi> that is, upon all thoſe amongſt them, that lived under the works of the Law, and were miſtaken, as you are. Are they not all in bondage? and doth not Gods wrath lye upon them at this day? ver. 25. Then again look the other way, <hi>See to Jeruſalem which is above,</hi> the Church in heaven, or the Church that hath her converſation in heaven, ſhe is free, ſhe got heaven by faith, and was juſtifyed by faith, and not by works; ſhe is our mother, ver. 26 ſo before <hi>was not Abraham our Father juſtifyed by faith?</hi> And here, <hi>Is not the Church our mother got to heaven by faith?</hi> And what, ſhall we think to be juſtifyed by our works? No ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> it is a miſtake; for <hi>the deſolate</hi> i. e. the Gentile-Church, <hi>ſhall have more children then the warryed wife,</hi> i. e. the Jewiſh Church: therefore let the Gentiles rejoyce rather, and be thankful that God hath made them more fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful then to fall back to a covenant of works: and then again he brings in <hi>Iſaac.</hi> Look to him, <hi>For as he was, we are children of promiſe.</hi> As if he had ſaid, we are to look to <hi>Abrahams</hi> covenant, and how the promiſe was made with him, and his ſeed. The preſent conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Church reſembles that family: though he had many chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; yet there was but one <hi>Iſaac,</hi> to whom the covenant was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed: therefore away with this Juſtification by works, caſt it out, it will not make you heirs, <hi>ſo then brethren we are not children of the bond-woman, but of the free.</hi> Thus you have briefly the natural mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the places; after all thoſe unheard of parallels, and confuſed conſtructions, wherewith it hath been intangled, to make it ſpeak for a knocking of that little <hi>nail</hi> of <hi>Infants</hi> out of that ſure place of Gods houſe.</p>
               <p>The next Scripture that falls in to be conſidered, is <hi>Act.</hi> 13, 45, 46. <hi>when the Jews ſaw the multitude, they were filled with envy, and ſpake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe things that were ſpoken: then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold

               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> From this Text it is cleer, that when Chriſt the true ſeed was perſecuted by the Jews, and the Goſpel rejected; all thoſe children of the covenant of works were caſt forth of Gods Church; the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2 Suppoſe they had been wholly left by the Apoſtles, and ſo were all in bondage with their children (as thats the drift of his words) then their rejecting the Goſpel, which cauſed the Apoſtles to leave them, was the ground of theirs, and their childrens falling into bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage.

                  <hi>P.</hi> Pag 147. He brings <hi>Lev</hi> 10.1, 2. and compares Infant-baptiſm, <hi>to their offering ſtrange fire to God,</hi> which he had not commanded, for which God burnt them with fire from heaven. —</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Tis a very good leſſon, well learnt, but by that rule he would be put by as a perſon not fit for a Miniſter of the Goſpel; how much ſtrange fire hath he caſt up and down theſe Nations, ſuch, by which he hath at leaſt endeavoured to burn down whole Churches? And how much ſtrange water hath he overwhelmed poor weak Chriſtians by, to the diſhonor of God and his ways? God is gentle in driving his flock, and the tender Lambs he carries in his boſom, and gives them reſt; and tells them his yoak is eaſie: but his opinion and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice is to perſwade the people of God that they ſerve a hard Maſter, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>That be they never ſo weak and tender, yet muſt they ſtoop to a deſtructive practice, and that in the ſharpeſt ſeaſons, as if men and women were made of ſome other mettle, and not fleſh and blood. But methinks the Scripture he brings ſhould make him ſee his error. If <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihues</hi> ſin was offering up ſuch fire which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded not, then it ſeems God expected, they ſhould pick out his meaning, by comparing things rationally together; for they had no expreſs command not to offer ſuch, or what fire they ſhould offer; but fire they were to offer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by which we ſee, if God gives but the hint of a truth, he will have his children to finde out the whole: ſo that, had we onely the hint of Gods minde touching <hi>Abrahams</hi> covenant, how it took in believers and their ſeed under the Old-Teſtament; and it being a covenant of pure grace, and therefore unchangable; reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Gentiles, and ſuch an example as he gave in <hi>Zacheus</hi> a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, calling him a ſon of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and therefore ſalvation was come to his houſe: I ſay ſuch hints as theſe, had we nothing elſe to ſay; were enough for us Gentiles to pick out the reſt; that if they had <hi>Abrahams</hi> covenant and bleſſing given, then in the ſame extent, and ſurely the ſeal muſt follow. I onely touch this by the by. It
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:168338:65"/> hath been before cleared, that every part and parcel of Gods word is for us, to juſtifie our practice of Infant-baptiſm.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> This appeal is made to you that fear the Lord, you ſee what his four laſt words ſpeak, viſible, graceleſs, Chriſtleſs children, but why viſible? was <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſo when an Infant, who was the ſeed of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe? and doth not <hi>Paul</hi> tell us, as he was, we are <hi>children of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe?</hi> If as he was, then as the ſeed of covenanting believers as he was, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.28. ſee the cenſorious ſpirit of this man, who is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to ſay, believers ſeed are viſibly graceleſs, when as <hi>Paul</hi> tells us they are to be <hi>reputed holy:</hi> 1 Cor. 7.

               <p>However, you to whom the appeal is made, receive it, and when you have done, make your complaint to God, and be not frighted from owning thoſe which God owns, the King is bound to maintain the cauſe of his ſubjects. And ſuch are Infants. <hi>For of ſuch is the

                  <hi>P.</hi> p. 153. He comes to lay down an Objection of ſuch as would have no baptiſm at all; which though it doth not ſo properly relate to us that maintain it, yet</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I ſhall give the Reader this hint, whatſoever he ſaith, for dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of believers, it hath been already anſwered. And therefore let me adviſe you to be ſo far either from caſting off the Ordinance, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing a falſe Ordinance; that you keep cloſe to that good old way of baptiſing the family-Infants of Jeſus Chriſt, and for the better ſtrengthening of ſuch, whoſe weakneſs may not be able to oppoſe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans depths: as that good woman once ſaid, ſhe could dye for Chriſt, but was not able enough to diſpute for him. Beſides what is before laid down, conſider <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.43. <hi>The kingdom of God ſhall be taken from you, and given to another nation, bringing forth the fruits thereof.</hi> The kingdom of God there mentioned, was the Church of the Jews who had the laws and the Ordinances of worſhip amongſt them; in which kingdom were included as ſubjects, men, women, and children by vertue of Gods covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> the father of all Church-incorporated-believers, both Jews and Gentiles, then and now. Now ſaith Chriſt, this kingdom of God ſhould be taken from the Jews, and given to the Gentiles; from whence then we may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gather, that if Gods kingdom now given to the Gentiles, be the ſame for ſubſtance, with that which was taken away from the Jews; then muſt the Infants of Church-believers, be alſo ſubjects of this kingdom, as they were then; and the reaſon is undenyable, becauſe it is implyed in the words of Chriſt. Not to be another, but the ſame kingdom; for had the Jews been fruitful ſubjects, the kingdom had ſtill remained with them, and not been removed.</p>
               <p>A ſecond place to be conſidered is that of <hi>Paul. Heb.</hi> 3.5.6. <hi>And Moſes verily was faithful in his houſe as a ſervant. But Chriſt as a ſon over his own houſe, whoſe houſe are we.</hi> The Apoſtles intent was to draw a parallel betwixt the family of God then, and now; in both which families Chriſt was the ſon. And the firſt houſe was as well Chriſts houſe, as the ſecond, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.13. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56.7. compared, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is this, that as the family of Chriſt in the firſt Goſpel-houſe to <hi>Iſrael</hi> did conſiſt partly of children, ſo doth the family of Chriſt in this ſecond Goſpel-houſe, conſiſt of the ſame; for it would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable to think, that Chriſt had changed the family, and ſo cut off children now; ſuch thoughts repreſent him to be leſs faithful then <hi>Moſes</hi> who was but a ſervant.</p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:168338:66"/>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But what command have you for your practice? theſe are na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tural inferences, but nothing ſhould be practiſed without a command.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> If this Objection be admitted, then as before, the Sabboth is null; becauſe there is not a cleer New-Teſtament command to keep it, and yet ſhould it not be obſerved, the Ordinances of the Goſpel muſt fall. For what Ordinances can be practiſed, if there be not a time appointed by Chriſt that ſhall bind all Chriſtians, which yet muſt be found out from Scriptures compared, the old-Teſtament and new, being laid together and not ſevered, with the conſtant practice of all Chriſtian Churches from the primitive time, ſo that they may as well make the Sabboth-day Antichriſtian, becauſe it wants ſuch an inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, as Infant-baptiſm, for they are inſeparable twins.</p>
               <p n="2">2 But the Scriptures do hold forth a command from <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Go and diſciple all Nations, baptizing,</hi> &amp;c. It hath been before cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that this command reaches children: to which I refer the Reader in anſwer to his four Eſſentials. But the ſadneſs of our times is, that men have ſuch itching ears; that notwithſtanding the Scriptures ſpeak and the ſpirit ſpeaks, and Gods Miniſters ſpeak, yet they will not hear:</p>

Now the bond of the covenant was given as the ſtanding rule of the houſe, to <hi>Abraham</hi> as the Church-Father of all covenanting believers, both Jews and Gentiles, <hi>Rom</hi> 4.11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.28.

And yet <hi>Paul</hi> tells us they were baptized, and <hi>David</hi> in the place before quoted tells us, how the clouds poured forth wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: the like appears from <hi>Act.</hi> 1.3. ch. 2.17. with <hi>Joel</hi> 2. compared, tis cleer that baptiſm was by pouring out water: to intrude ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive practice is therefore againſt the Apoſtolical interpretation of the word, and againſt the very light of divine or humane reaſon: for ſhall we think that he that bids us <hi>put on as the beloved of God, bowels of mercy, and tenderneſs,</hi> ſhould be ſo hard a maſter, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand us in the moſt ſharpeſt ſeaſons to be duckt; yea, an action that cannot be done in many Countries? for ſhame, harden not your hearts againſt truth any longer, and be of a more tender hearted ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to poor deluded Chriſtians; and do you that fear the Lord, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that you do not abuſe your power God hath given; to ſuch licencious practice, that would ruine the very foundations of the Goſpel.</p>

                  <hi>P.</hi> p. 164. Doth acknowledge there may be good people not of his opinion, yet they are not to be lookt upon as a Church, unleſs they will be dipt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He hath before called us ſuch as offer up our children to devils, and can he have ſo much charity to judge ſuch good people? theſe are but terms of inſinuations to gain the more upon ſuch good people to bring them into his ſtrain of diſcipleſhip. He brings us again, the example of <hi>Cornelius, Lydia,</hi> the Jaylor, and then tells us the Church of <hi>Samaria</hi> was gathered by faith and dipping: and to practice o her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, is contrary to Chriſt and the Apoſtles. All which is before proved falſe, and there is not a word in the Scriptures that ſaith as M. <hi>P.</hi> doth, that the Church mentioned was gathered by dipping: yea ſo to practice and apply it as he doth is to adulterate, and ſo deſtroy the Ordinance. Away therefore with ſuch ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>P.</hi> p. 172, 173. He perſwades Chriſtians it is a ſin to neglect plung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and if they have truely repented, they will be drawn to practice all the commands of God, and this amongſt the reſt; or elſe they cannot be admitted as perſons that have repented at all.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> We may here ſee the myſtery of iniquity in its workings: It muſt Lord it in the Conſcience, or elſe it cannot ſtand: thus did thoſe Circumciſion-preachers, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. there was no ſalvation without it, as here, there is no repentance tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> p. 174. But ſome will ſay they were baptized in their infancy, and ſhall ſuch be kept out that are good people? To which he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, that though many are good, yet they live in a ſin, though it be a ſin of ignorance to them; for otherwiſe they could not be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. But however the Church knows it to be a ſin, therefore they ought to be kept out; and if any ſuch be in, that baptize their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, they ought to be caſt out. —</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Reader may ſtill ſee his cenſorious ſpirit, wherein he flyes in the face of all the Miniſters of Chriſt, wounding their credit and eſteem in the hearts of Chriſtians. For whoſoever doth knowingly oppoſe their dipping, and not ignorantly, cannot be gracious, ſo that either the Miniſtery muſt be ignorant, or graceleſs. And that their Church knows it to be a ſin, and therefore ought to keep out, and caſt out ſuch as practice it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I hope you ſhall have no cauſe to threaten ſuch with caſting out: and if you ſpeak in the name of all the Anabaptiſts, when you ſay the Church knows it to be a ſin, I muſt then needs ſay they are as ignorant as your ſelf, though it is hard ſo to be. —</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> In p. 176. he uſeth another way to make us yield up to his pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, and anſwers an Objection that ſome do make, that though it be an Ordinance, yet many do reſt in it: and therefore its better not to practice it: he grants that many do reſt in them, yet he would admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh all thoſe that fear God to be conformable, ſo was <hi>Paul</hi> Gal. 1.16
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:168338:68"/> ſo was <hi>Peter,</hi> when Chriſt bids him let down his net, ſo was <hi>Abraham</hi> in ſacrificing his ſon; he diſputed not, and therefore he would have Chriſtians ſuck in this as a maxim, never to diſpute a command, and ſo he concludes his whole with <hi>Phil.</hi> 2, 12: <hi>Do all things without mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murings and diſputings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> We are now drawing to an end, in all which we may ſee how many ways, and wiles the Tempter hath, to get within us; he uſeth his weapons every way, and comes ſo high now, that it is a ſin againſt Conſcience to diſpute it, and it muſt be ſuckt down as a maxim, which I could eaſily grant, if it could be proved that either the ſubject, or manner were commanded as it is by him practiſed. But he that ſo ſucks it in, had as good ſuck down Ratsbane. The inſtances brought are of ſuch who had a cleer command, for what they did from Chriſt himſelf, hold forth therein nothing relating to dipping. In fine we may ſay of his whole book, it is nothing elſe but a lump of error, and bitter revilings againſt the ways of God, and Miniſtery of his word, wherein he hath dealt like thoſe unfaithful ſpyes, that went to view the Land of promiſe, who by the ill reports he makes, diſturbs the multitude, and ſets them a murmuring againſt Gods <hi>Joſhuas;</hi> that ſo his people may either retreat back to <hi>Egypt,</hi> or run into <hi>Babylon.</hi> His charge againſt us appears to be falſe, the truth is cleered from the contempt and reproach caſt upon it. Reader, I ſhall therefore commit thee to the grace &amp; keeping of our <hi>L.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>And as for ſuch who turn aſide to their wicked ways, the Lord ſhall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity.</hi> But peace ſhall be upon <hi>Iſrael, Pſal.</hi> 125.5.</p>
